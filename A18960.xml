         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IR, hauing been certaine yeeres ſince, more preſt, and forward to offer our ſelues to be doing then duly conſiderate what a burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous taske wee ſhould vndergoe, one of vs vndertook the explication of the <hi>Prouerbs of Salomon,</hi> and the other to further the ſame by inſpection, and aſſiſtance in diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult &amp; doubtfull places, when need ſhould require. But we found it a matter of greater trauell, and longer labour then we thought of, and haue met with ſuch interruptions as we had iuſt cauſe to looke for, but did not ſufficiently foreſee: for (beſides that the book is wholly ſententious, and the vnfolding of ſentences requireth breuitie, and perſpicuitie, with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruth, and ſoundnes, which cannot be attained vnto without mature deliberation and ſtudie) the Lord himſelfe did ſtop our paſſage with his owne hand, for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by viſiting one of vs, euen him who was to doe the worke, and ſuſtaine the burthen of the buſineſſe, with ſuch defect of health and ſight, as did actually prohibite our courſe of proceeding. But now (by his good hand) that let being remoued and his aſſiſtance ministred vnto vs, we at the laſt haue waded thorow the booke, or rather haue ſwomme ouer it: for it is ſo profound and deepe with perfect excellencie, that neither we, or any man elſe can diue to the bottome of it. <hi>Salomon</hi> himſelfe was farre too low of ſtature, and not tall enough in vnderſtanding, euen (when he knew moſt) to ſtand in it, and hold vp his head aboue the myſticall waters of
<pb facs="tcp:26745:3"/> admirable wiſedome, although his tongue did ſpeake it, and his hand penne it. We haue by due conſideration with our ſelues, and iudicious aduice from our wiſe and learned brethren, proceeded in a courſe different from our beginning, labouring only to make the text as plaine and conſpicuous, as wee could in ſo few words, without our former additions of Doctrines and Vſes. For we ſaw the time would be long before we could finiſh the worke: the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting would be chargeable, if wee ſhould liue to bring it to the preſſe: the boo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es would be deare to ſuch as ſhould buy them: and the paines would be tedious to thoſe which ſhould reade them: and albeit ſome might haue more benefit by ſo large a volume, yet more may haue ſome benefit by this compendious contriuall: for the very knowledge of the right ſenſe of the Scriptures (which in this marke we chiefly aime at) is very commodious in ſundrie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and the ground-worke of all pietie. That maketh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to be fruitfull Preachers: that maketh priuate perſons to be profitable hearers: that yeeldeth matter of wholeſome medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the minde: that putteth vigour of good affections into the heart: that miniſtreth ſtore of vſefull ſpeeches to the lippes, and that prepareth a way for faith, for repentance, and all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall graces and externall obedience to the whole man. The want hereof is the cauſe why the words of God are ſo much by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted publikely to ſuch purpoſes, as the holy Ghoſt neuer inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, both preſſes, and pulpits (which is with teares to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſending out ſo many erroneous writings, and ſayings, for the confirmation of ſeperation, ſuperstition, iniustice, ſenſuall lusts, and all manner of licentiouſnes: and why being by others ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleaged they are ſo greatly mistaken, and worke no better ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in thoſe to whom they are preached. For this cauſe wee haue not been altogether remiſſe in ſearching out, and ſounding the ſenſe of euery ſentence of this booke, or in pondering the force of euery word which may ſeeme to carrie ſome weight, ſo farre as our knowledge, or meanes would extend: but if the learned of better iudgement ſhall any where finde vs failing, let them bee pleaſed to make it appeare vnto vs, and wee doe promiſe not to ſtand wilfully, or peremptorily in any error, but to be attentiue to their reaſons, and reformable in our opinions. What wee haue
<pb facs="tcp:26745:3"/> done herein, we thinke it our dutie to recommend as a testimonie of our loue to your Worſhips patronage, not doubting but that you will diligently reade, and wiſely iudge of it, as you doe of other bookes of this nature, notwithstanding your manifold and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie imployments otherwiſe. Wee reſt aſſured of your charitable minde, that without offence you will beare with our homely kinde of writing, although it be deuoid of all poliſhment, and elegancy, conſidering that we make but an expoſition to informe the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the meaning of the Scripture, and not a diſcourſe to work vpon affections: it is ſufficient that the foundation ſtones lying in the ground, bee firme, and ſtable, although not beautifully he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen, carued, or grauen. The ſentences which we explaine are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent as well for matter, as manner, and defectiue in nothing that may giue ſatisfaction to the beſt qualified, and moſt compleate Christian in the world. Wiſe readers therefore (we doubt not) will be intreated to content their eyes with the bright and ſhining beames thereof, that they may not neede to require any exact per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in this our dimme and duskiſh Commentarie.

The marke that we aime at herein is the glorie of God, and the edification of his ſeruants, and not our owne praiſe and commendation for eloquence. And thus with remembrance of our dutie, referring the whole worke to your wiſe and louing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, wee commit you and your gracious yoke-fellow to the bleſſed protection of God Almightie, beſeeching him daily more and more to multiplie all his graces and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies vpon your ſelfe, and yours. <hi>Draiton</hi> this 10. of May 1615.</p>

               <p>THe knowledge mentioned in the former verſe, is ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this, both by the cauſe of it, inſtruction receiued, whereby vnderſtanding is gotten, and the effects of it: the firſt whereof is <hi>iustice,</hi> which is not reſtrained to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates office, nor to the duties of the ſecond table of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, but to be extended to all the waies of men, that they be warrantable, and lawfull: the ſecond is <hi>iudgement,</hi> which is with mature deliberation to regard all cauſes, and circumſtances, that any way tend to the due manner of our proceedings: the third is <hi>equitie,</hi> that we doe not only walke with an euen foote, neither turning to the right hand, nor to the left, but to propoſe a right end alſo in all that we deale in, with truth of heart, and vprightnes.</p>
               <p>Verſe 4. <hi>To giue to the ſimple ſharpneſſe of wit, and to the child knowledge, and diſcretion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe generall vſe of this booke, and that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, hath been ſhewed in the two former verſes: now here followeth that which is ſpeciall, and concerneth ſome kinds of men, as the ſimpler ſort in this verſe, and the learneder in the next.</p>
               <p>And it is vttered by way of anticipation, or obiection that might be made againſt the premiſes, in this manner: Theſe Prouerbs are profound, and deepe ſentences, and the more ſhort they are, the more hard and obſcure they be: well may great ſchollers, and men of much learning gather wiſedome, and knowledge from them, but wee that are ſimple and ſillie perſons, vnlettered, vnlearned, and dull of vnderſtanding; ſhall neuer be able to reape any profit by them: Yes (ſaith he) all ſorts, that are exerciſed in them aright, ſhall receiue good by them, one as well as another. The firſt ſort he calleth by two names, <hi>ſimple,</hi> and <hi>children:</hi> by ſimple, vnderſtanding thoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:26745:6"/> perſons, whom elſewhere he calleth <hi>fooliſh,</hi> ignorant, vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,<note place="margin">Prou. 14. 5.</note> and ſuch as beleeue euery thing told them, and yeeld to euery thing impoſed vpon them. To theſe this booke will giue ſharpnes of wit, that is, a good capacitie, with quicknes of conceit, cunning (as the word ſignifieth) or ſubtiltie: but ſuch as is harmeleſſe, and holy, not whereby they are apt to beguile others, but able (notwithſtanding their doue-like ſimplicitie) to beware and take heed to themſelues, that they be not beguiled of others: which kinde of wiſedome our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour<note place="margin">Matth. 10. 16.</note> himſelfe commendeth in the Goſpell. By <hi>child</hi> he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not babes and infants by age, through want of yeeres, but whatſoeuer yeeres they haue on their backes, hee calleth them children, if they be nouices lacking iudgement, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or raſh, vnſetled or mutable in that which they know. To theſe this booke will giue knowledge, and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſoundnes in iudgement, ſtaiednes in affection, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ordering all their waies.</p>
               <p>Verſe 5. <hi>A wiſe man ſhall heare and increaſe in learning, and a man of vnderſtanding ſhall attaine vnto wiſe counſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 6. <hi>To vnderſtand a parable, and the interpretation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the words of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOw wee come to the ſecond ſort of them, to whoſe vſe and profit the Prouerbs are deſtinated, who are ſet forth by two titles: firſt they are ſaid to be <hi>wiſe</hi> indeed, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent knowledge of things diuine, and humane: ſecondly, they are called <hi>men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of vnderſtanding,</hi> ſuch as are qualified with an excellent facultie of perceiuing, diſcerning, and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things, that they are not eaſie to bee miſled, or decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>And theſe words as well as the former tend to the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an obiection, which out of the former might be raiſed in this manner: If your ſayings and ſentences be ſo plaine and eaſie, that the ſimple may ſound them, and the child may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them; what good will they doe to the wiſe and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? men of iudgement and knowledge ſhall loſe their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26745:6"/> and miſpend their time in reading of them, what ſhall they get more then they haue alreadie? Yea (ſaith hee) the greateſt Clerkes, and deepeſt Diuines, may gather inſtruction from them, as well as the vulgar and meaner ſort of people. They are ſhallow enough for a little childe to wade in, and deepe enough for a great Leuiathan to ſwimme in. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid that a <hi>wiſe man by hearing ſhall increaſe in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> that is, there ſhall be added to him a great meaſure of knowledge, <hi>and ſhall attaine to wiſe counſels,</hi> to wit, ſhall bee inabled to get and purchaſe, poſſeſſe, and keepe <hi>industrious counſels or thoughts,</hi> euen ſuch whereby he may be as skilfull in things pertaining to him and his affaires, as the Maſter of a ſhip is in ſtearing and gouerning it in the greateſt dangers: for from thence is the word borrowed. Now this is further amplified in the ſixth verſe, that they ſhall cauſe him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand (for ſo the Hebrew word ſignifieth) <hi>a parable,</hi> any prouerbiall ſentence, though difficult and obſcure to others, and <hi>the interpretation thereof,</hi> the true ſenſe and meaning of it, <hi>the words of the wiſe, and their darke ſayings</hi> euen to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne of, and vnfold, the moſt intricate points, and to anſwere to the hardeſt queſtions or riddles, (as the originall text im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth) ſuch as the Queene of Sheba poſed <hi>Salomon</hi> withall.<note place="margin">1.

               <p>Verſ. 7. <hi>The feare of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge: but fooles deſpiſe wiſedome, and inſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THus much concerning the title or inſcription: now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth the treatiſe it ſelfe, which hath two parts: firſt, the preparation to the prouerbiall ſentence, containing many notable exhortations, and arguments to the ſtudie and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of that wiſedome, which is contained in this booke, laid downe in the firſt nine Chapters. Secondly, the prouerbiall ſayings themſelues, from the beginning of the tenth, to the end of the booke.</p>
               <p>In this preſent verſe is propoſed the principall propoſition, and ſumme of theſe nine Chapters, that is, <hi>the feare of the Lord,</hi> a reuerent awe of his Maieſtie, proceeding from faith,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26745:7"/> wherby through the feeling of his loue, as well as the weight of his diſpleaſure, we are afraid to offend him, true pietie and godlineſſe (for it is a part for the whole worſhip of God, whereof it is a principall part, and as it were the cuſtos and keeper of the reſt in their duties, all euill being committed where it is wanting) <hi>is the beginning</hi> or head <hi>of knowledge,</hi> the foundation and top, the entrance, proceeding, and perfection of wiſedome.</p>
               <p>In the latter part of the verſe, hee meeteth with an obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is made in this manner: As much as you praiſe this wiſdome, who regardeth it? is it not deſpiſed of the moſt part, and reiected euery where? True (ſaith he) but what are they which contemne it? <hi>fooles,</hi> meaning all wicked men. And therefore it is no matter what account they make of it, vnleſſe they were wiſer. The oppoſition then of this ſentence ſtandeth thus: <hi>The feare of the Lord is the beginning of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and wiſe men will embrace it: but how excellent ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>wiſedome</hi> and inſtruction is <hi>fooles will</hi> haue it in no eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but ſet light by it, and deſpiſe it.</p>
               <p>Verſe 8. <hi>My ſonne heare thy fathers inſtruction, and forſake not thy mothers teaching.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 9. <hi>For they ſhall be a comely ornament vnto thy head, and as chaines for thy necke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TRue wiſedome hauing been before deſcribed, and the feare of God commended, he adioyneth an exhortation to embrace the ſame, by making vſe of the meanes thereof:</p>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>In the precept are to be vnderſtood, the ſubiects of it, the perſons to whom it is directed, euery faithfull reader, and therefore hee ſpeaketh to all, as if it were one man, and that out of pure loue, euen as a father to his beloued childe: and becauſe hee ſhould hearken to him, as a louing childe to his father, he calleth him his ſonne.</p>
               <p>In the next place the matter of the precept is to be noted,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26745:7"/> that he heare the doctrine, whereby this wiſedome is offered, called <hi>inſtruction,</hi> and <hi>teaching,</hi> which hee commendeth by the efficient inſtrumentall, to wit, his parents, which ſhould incite him, to be attentiue to both, and contemptuous to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The promiſe is laid downe in an eligant ſimilitude, ſuiting with the capacitie and affections of children, to whom hee ſpeaketh, that <hi>they,</hi> namely <hi>inſtruction and teaching,</hi> heard, and not forſaken, <hi>ſhall be a comely ornament,</hi> in Hebrew, an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of grace to thy head, and as chaines for thy necke,</hi> they ſhal ſo garniſh and decke thee, that if a crowne of gold were ſet vpon thy head, and a chaine of pearles were put about thy necke, thou couldeſt not be more adorned, and beautified before God, and men.</p>
               <p>Verſe 10. <hi>My ſonne, if ſinners doe intice thee, conſent thou not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THis verſe, and the nine next following, containe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent caueat, to take heed of, and auoid thoſe meanes, which make the inſtructions of parents, or other gouernours, fruitleſſe, and of none effect, namely, pernicious, and peſtilent inticements. This matter he doth here propound in generall, and more particularly amplifie afterwards, in that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>In the generall he forewarneth his <hi>ſonne,</hi> that is, euery god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, and ſuch as addict themſelues to wiſedome and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, to beware of ſeducers, ſhewing both what manner of perſons they are, to wit, <hi>ſinners,</hi> and how to be auoided, by not conſenting vnto them, or giuing the leaſt eare, or liking to their flatteries and deceitfull perſwaſions.</p>
               <p>Verſe 11. <hi>If they ſay, Come with vs, we will lay wait for blood, and lie priuily for the innocent without perill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HEre followeth the particular handling of the fotmer matter, in this verſe, and diuers of the reſt that follow:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26745:8"/> wherein are ſet downe, firſt the inticing ſpeeches of ſinners, as it were motiues to winne conſent, and aftetwards the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome diſſwaſion of the holy Ghoſt as a retentiue to hold them backe from yeelding. In both which we haue the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, or that whereunto they doe moue vs, and the ſeuerall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whereupon the ſame is grounded. The motiues of the wicked, are to worke miſchiefe, and to practiſe crueltie by cunning: which the ſpirit of God ſetteth downe according to their meaning, in odious termes, ſuch as their owne lippes would not ſo apertly vtter, and eſpecially at the firſt: for it were enough to fright and diſcourage one, yet not fleſhed in ſinne, to heare ſuch words: <hi>Let vs lay waite for blood,</hi> vndoe men, either by taking away their liues, or hurting, if not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ouerthrowing their eſtates, which is their purpoſe, but not alway their pretence; <hi>and lie priuilie,</hi> like hunters for beaſts, and fowlers for birds, or theeues by the waies ſide, and enemies in ambuſhment, diſſemble, and conceale our mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, trecherous, and hurtful plots, vntill we haue aduantage: <hi>for the innocent,</hi> whom God iuſtifieth, and approueth of, and who haue deſerued no ſuch intreatie at the hands of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors, whom clamorous tongues notwithſtanding ſpare not to depraue, as if they were culpable of hainous offences: <hi>without perill:</hi> for ſo doe the learned take the word here vſed, in ſome other place, as Iob. 9. 17. <hi>Hee destroyeth me with a tempeſt, and woundeth me without danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And hauing hitherto declared both the matter, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their allurements, he now beginneth to relate their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, whereby they goe about to inueigle the ſimple: and this firſt from the ſafetie of the attempt, that they may take it in hand, and proceed in it freely, and without feare of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is brought in the beginning, and placed in the fore-front, to animate them againſt all dread and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at the onſet.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:26745:8"/>
               <p>Verſe 12. <hi>Wee will ſwallow them vp aliue, like a graue, euen whole like thoſe that goe downe into the pit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOw followeth the ſecond reaſon of theſe tempters, drawne from the facilitie and eaſineſſe of their exploits, to preuent the doubts that might ariſe againſt their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, for the difficultie of their attempts, and the doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their ſucceſſe: becauſe that many that could bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to doe any euill, which may bring good to themſelues, or hurt to the innocent, yet for feare of foile, repulſe, or euill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, are the more vnwillingly drawne vnto it. Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inticers euermore take away this ſcruple, and make the ſimple beleeue that they can effect it without any trouble. They are able with much eaſe, and as little reſiſtance, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome and pray vpon the liuing, whom they take in hand to vndoe, as the graue doth receiue and conſume the dead corpſes, that are buried in it.</p>
               <p>Verſe 13. <hi>We ſhall finde all precious riches, and fill our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with ſpoile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THis verſe containeth their third reaſon, which is taken from the commodity that they ſhal get by their attempt, not pelfe, nor trumperie, not trifles of no value, but riches of all ſorts, and thoſe that are precious, and in abundance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they ſhall ſtore their houſes, as conquerours doe, when they haue the ſacking of cities, and carrie away the pray.</p>
               <p>Verſe 14. <hi>Thou ſhalt caſt in thy lot among vs: wee will all haue one purſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HEre is an obiection preuented, which the partie tempted may thinke or ſay: that he ſhall take as much paines as others, but finde leſſe gaines, ſeeing it is to be feared, that you being maſters in this trade, and captaines in miſchiefe, will challenge the moſt vnto your ſelues, and being many, and of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:26745:9"/> an old confederacie, will make my part the leaſt. Anſw. Yea the bootie ſhall be diuided moſt equally, and then according to the faſhion of Merchants, wee will caſt lots to determine each mans part, (and that which is more) thou ſhalt in the meane time haue money of vs if thou wanteſt, to defray thy charges: thou ſhalt liue of our purſe, and wee in the like caſe, will of thine, we will haue a common bagge among vs.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>My ſonne, walke not in the way with them: refraine thy foote from their path.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOw are we come to the retentiue, or diſſwaſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſpirit of God withholdeth his children from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the cunning inticements of ſinfull ſeducers, which he firſt beginneth with a dehortation, and then confirmeth with arguments.</p>
               <p>The dehortation is vſed in this verſe, as an antidote, or counterpoyſon againſt their virulent tongues, directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to their counſell or call. <hi>Come (ſay they</hi>) and goe with vs: <hi>my ſonne</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>walke not in the way with them,</hi> conuerſe not with ſuch in friendſhip, renounce their acquaintance, and haue little to doe with them: <hi>refraine thy foote from their path,</hi> be not where they haunt, or are, if thou canſt chuſe.</p>
               <p>Verſe 16. <hi>For with their feete they runne to euill, and make haſte to ſhed blood.</hi>

And this is aſſumed out of their owne words in the eleuenth verſe.</p>

They vſe al their art to take away life, and make a ſlaughter, and that they ſhall doe, but they are the men to bee killed, themſelues muſt be ſlaine. And where then is the ſafetie which they ſo much preſumed of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gaue warrant for, with ſuch confidence?</p>
               <p>Verſe 19. <hi>Such are the waies of euery one that is giuen to gaine; it will take away the life of the poſſeſſers of it.</hi>

And this is ſet foorth firſt by the author, ſecondly by the meane, thirdly by the matter.</p>
               <p>The author is <hi>Wiſedome</hi> or <hi>wiſedomes,</hi> the moſt high and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wiſedome <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> the eternall wiſedome of God, in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Col. 2. 3. who taketh vpon him here, and in certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chapters of this booke, the perſon of a Matrone, a Ladie, or Princeſſe, according to the feminine gender, whereof the word that ſignifieth wiſedome is in Hebrew.

               <p>The faults wherewith ſhe obbraideth them, are the habites of euill in them, as of <hi>ſimplicitie</hi> in the ſimple: of <hi>ſcorning</hi> in the ſcorners: of <hi>fooliſhnes</hi> in the fooles, whereof ſhe conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them by two arguments: one, that they are obſtinate, and perſiſt in them, which is intended in <hi>how long?</hi> the other, that their hearts and affections were poſſeſſed with them, in that they <hi>loued</hi> the ſame, and <hi>delighted</hi> therein, and <hi>hated</hi> to be cured of them.</p>

               <p>The dutie to be performed is repentance and reformation, which ſhe calleth turning, by a ſimilitude taken either from trauellers, that haue gone the wrong way, and muſt come back againe, or from ſeruants, or children, or ſouldiers, which haue run away from their gouernours, and ſo vndone them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>The motiues are two: the former is from that ſharpnes which the Lord had vſed toward them, either by rebukes or chaſtiſements: and the latter from that kindneſſe which hee would ſhew vnto them, the promiſe whereof is noted with the word of obſeruation, <hi>Behold,</hi> as intending a thing admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and worthie to be looked vpon of all: and ſo indeed are the things promiſed, the effects of his kindnes, as namely hee would beſtow his <hi>ſpirit</hi> vpon them, and gifts and graces of the holy Ghoſt, and that not ſparingly and in a ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but plentifully, and in great abundance, as rich fountaines cauſe their waters to boyle out; (for ſo doth the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie) and more particularly hee promiſeth to illuminate their minde, with the ſauing knowledge of his holie will, which is the worke and fruite of the ſpirit, that ſhall be powred vpon them.</p>
               <p>Verſe 24. <hi>For as much as I call, but yee refuſe, I ſtretch out mine hand, but none regardeth:</hi>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:26745:11"/>
               <p>Verſe 25. <hi>But ye deſpiſe all my counſell, and will none of my correction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HItherto Wiſedome hath perſwaded wicked men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, by expoſtulations, exhortations, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: now ſhe declareth the miſerable eſtate of wilfull perſons, with comminations, menaces, and threatnings.</p>
               <p>The iudgement that ſhe denounceth againſt them, is no leſſe then deſtruction it ſelfe, which is ſhewed by the cauſe of it, in theſe two verſes, and by the grieuouſnes of it, in the three next.</p>
               <p>The cauſe is obſtinacie and peruerſenes, whereof ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth them, partly by her benignitie and kinde dealing towards them, and partly by their ingratitude, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous behauiour towards her: <hi>ſhe calleth them</hi> by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitement, to be partakers of her graces: <hi>ſhe ſtretcheth out her hands</hi> vnto them: <hi>but they refuſed</hi> to hearken and yeeld o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to her voyce: <hi>none of them regarded</hi> the teſtimonies and tokens of her fauour: <hi>they deſpiſed,</hi> ſet naught by and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided <hi>her counſell,</hi> thoſe wholeſome precepts and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſhe gaue vnto them, <hi>and would none of her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections;</hi> they were wearie of her rebukes and chaſtiſements, but not amended by them.</p>
               <p>Verſe 26. <hi>I will alſo laugh at your calamitie, and mocke when your feare commeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 27. <hi>When your feare commeth like an horrible deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and your deſtruction approcheth as a whirle-winde: when affliction and anguiſh ſhall come vpon you:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 28. <hi>Then they ſhall call vpon me, but I will not heare, they ſhall ſeeke me earely, but they ſhall not finde me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe cauſe of their miſerie hauing been expreſſed in the premiſſes, the grieuouſnes thereof is in theſe words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: as firſt that they ſhall be comfortleſſe, and helpleſſe, the Lord ſhewing himſelfe righteouſly vnmercifull to them in <hi>laughing at them and ſcorning them:</hi> not that there is in
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:26745:12"/> the Lord any diſpoſition of laughter, or <hi>ſcorning,</hi> but for mans capacitie he is often in the Scriptures reſembled to man with humane affections: as here, becauſe he will not care for them, but caſt them off, he is ſaid to deride them; for that it is a miſerie not to be relieued in miſerie, but a double corſie and woe to be ieſted at of thoſe who onely can helpe them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the manner of the plague amplified with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words and ſimilies, doth proue it to bee grieuous: as, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will be terrible, and make them ſore afraid, it is called by the name of <hi>feare,</hi> and it is ſaid to <hi>come like an horrible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation:</hi> the word properly ſignifieth a furious breach of any thing, breaking and ouerthrowing whatſoeuer it meeteth with: and it is compared to a <hi>whirle-winde,</hi> which commeth ſuddenly and with great violence, not onely blowing vp duſt, and chaffe, and light matter, but blowing downe oftentimes trees, and houſes, and ſtrong buildings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the effects which it will worke ſhall giue teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſufficient of the ſharpnes of Gods proceedings againſt them: for that their hearts ſhall be filled with affliction, and anguiſh, and their tongues ſhall be compelled through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie of torment and danger to crie to him, whom they haue contemned, but to no purpoſe, and without ſucceſſe: for he will <hi>not anſwere</hi> them, that is, grant their requeſts, but will teſtifie his wrath, and increaſe their ſorrow, by denying the things they pray for: yea the greatnes of their diſtreſſe ſhall inforce them to ſeeke him earely, very diligently and carefully, they ſhall ſpare no paines, they ſhall breake their ſleepes in the morning, and <hi>yet ſhall not finde him</hi> gracious and mercifull to them in their griefes and perplexities.</p>
               <p>Verſe 29. <hi>Becauſe they hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the feare of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 30. <hi>They would none of my counſell, but despiſed all my corrections.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HE inſiſteth ſtill vpon the point in hand, and iuſtifieth his accuſation, by repetition of thoſe ſinnes which would
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:26745:12"/> cauſe them to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſo fearefully plagued. And in reckoning them vp, he beginneth with that wherewith hee ended in the expoſtulation, <hi>their hatred of knowledge:</hi> and whereas he vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided them with refuſall of wiſdomes gratious offers, and that they regarded them not, hee maketh it good by this, that they <hi>choſe not the feare of the Lord,</hi> they would not learne to be religious and godly, when meanes and opportunities were miniſtred vnto them. And before it was ſaid vnto them, <hi>ye haue deſpiſed all my counſell, and would none of my correction;</hi> here it is ſaid of them, <hi>they would none of my counſell, but haue deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all my correction;</hi> the ſenſe is the ſame though the words be ſomewhat varied.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 31. <hi>Therefore ſhall they eate of the fruit of their owne, and be filled with their owne deuices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe former two verſes contained a rehearſall of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and this a renewing of the threatning, wherein he declareth their deſtruction to bee iuſt, and according to their owne deſerts, by a ſimilitude in this manner: euen as it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall that planters or plowmen ſhould eate of the fruit or graine which they haue nouriſhed or ſowne, and laboured for, eſpecially if they haue encreaſed much fruit, or ſowne much corne, or taken much paines, that then they ſhould bee partakers of the labours of their hands more plentifully: ſo ſtandeth it with the righteouſneſſe of God to giue to theſe that <hi>they may eate of the fruit of their owne way,</hi> that is, taſte of that ſorrow and confuſion which their diſſolute liues and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hearts doe duly demerit. <hi>And bee filled with their owne deuices;</hi> albeit they could neuer make an end of inuenting and practiſing that which is euill, yet they ſhall bee ſated at laſt, and ſurcharged with the effects therof. Such fulnes of ſhame, griefe, deſperation, and all manner of torment, that they ſhall feele themſelues ouerburthened therewith, as is the ſtomacke, when it is oppreſſed with too much meate, and made ſicke by a ſurfeit.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:26745:13"/>
               <p>Verſ. 32. <hi>For the turning away of the ſimple ſlaieth them: and the proſperitie of fooles deſtroyeth them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe former part of this verſe is annexed to the premiſſes, both as an explication and confirmation of the ſame: for what are the <hi>waies</hi> which <hi>ſimple</hi> ones (that is, ſuch as haue not diſcretion to get knowledge, when it is offered) <hi>ſhall eate the fruite of their turning away,</hi> their wilfull refuſall of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes inſtructions, which they will neither learne, nor obey, nor with any liking ſo much as looke towards: and what are the fruites which ſuch ſinfull waies doe cauſe thoſe ſimple id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iots to eate of? death and damnation: <hi>they ſlay them:</hi> if they bring not violence vpon their bodies, yet they bring both body and ſoule to perdition for euer. The latter part preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth an obiection that might be made, and often is, againſt this and the former ſentences of wiſedome: Doth contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous turning away ſlay the ſimple? and doe deſpiſers eate the fruites of their owne waies? how commeth it to paſſe then, that of all others they commonly thriue beſt, and few are found ſo proſperous, and in ſo good eſtate as they? The anſwere is made that <hi>the proſperitie of fooles ſhall deſtroy them,</hi> both in haſtning their iudgements, and making it the more grieuous: and ſo ſtoppeth not, but furthereth the executions of wiſedomes threatnings.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 33. <hi>But he that obeyeth me ſhall dwell ſafely from feare of euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LAſtly, this point is amplified, and ſo ſhut vp by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, namely the behauiour and condition of the godly, altogether oppoſite to that of the ſimple ones, ſcorners, and fooles, formerly deſcribed: for theſe here commended, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not wiſedome, nor turne away from her, but hearken at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiuely, and yeeld obedience vnto her: and therefore they liue not in danger of death, of plagues and puniſhments, but <hi>dwell ſafely,</hi> are out of perill of deſtruction, or of any hurt,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:26745:13"/> though not exempted from all croſſes and ſufferings, and bee <hi>quiet from feare of euill,</hi> not onely no euill it ſelfe, ſuch as would be noiſome and pernicious, ſhall affray them, but not ſo much as a ſuſpition and dread of it ſhall goe to his heart, to diſmay him. Yet becauſe no man can perfectly obey wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in all things, the beſt in their infirmities are ſometimes perplexed and troubled with doubts, but neuer ſubdued, or vtterly diſcouraged by them.

The duties are ſet downe generally in this firſt verſe, and more particularly in three next following.</p>
               <p>The generall dutie is to giue due intertainment to Gods holy meſſages firſt by <hi>receiuing his words,</hi> not onely to heare them when they are graciouſly tendered, but gladly and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embrace them with vnderſtanding, and ſo to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and moued in heart with the power of them, as to deſire and endeuour to obey them, and then <hi>by hiding his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements</hi> to keepe them carefully being receiued, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and made lightſome by a compariſon taken from the charineſſe of men, in preſeruing of their money, their iewels, or ought elſe that is precious vnto them: for ſuch things they vſe to lay vp ſafely, and keepe them vnder locke and key, that they be not robbed and beguiled of them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THe particular duties are the exerciſe of theſe meanes, whereby knowledge and grace is obtained: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foure in number, two are contained in this verſe, and in the third, and the laſt in the fourth. The former of the two is the attention of the eare, not hearing onely but hearkening, and diligent heed taking, to that which is ſpoken, making the eare to attend and hearken. The latter in place, though firſt in order, is the deſire of the ſoule, which metaphorically, and by a compariſon from corporall ſubſtances, hee calleth the bowing of the heart, the inforcing of it by the helpe of the ſpirit, to be religiouſly affected at Gods ſacred ordinances.</p>

And this is ſet forth by a compariſon, <hi>as men dig for ſiluer,</hi> euen with as much paines, great coſt, earneſt affection, and conſtant continuance therein till we haue found it, euen as the worldly man doth for ſiluer or gold, or any treaſure which is hid in ſome cloſe, ſtrong and ſecret place, as in the ground or within a wall, whether men cannot come, but by toile and great labour: and yet not impoſſible to bee compaſſed by paines taking.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THeſe words are added for a double vſe, as well to be a confirmation of the promiſe, as an amplification of that excellent gift which is promiſed, and they aptly ſerue for both. For (touching the former) how ſhould they which in due manner ſeeke wiſdome miſſe of it, ſeeing that he which incourageth them to labour for it with aſſurance of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, is he which hath the diſpoſing of it, and that is <hi>Iehouah</hi> himſelfe, the eternall, vnchangeable, and alſufficient, who can eaſily worke it with a word, as the manner deſcribed impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>out of his mouth commeth vnderſtanding.</hi> That is by his bleſſing, it being in a borrowed ſpeech aſcribed to God, which properly belongeth to man, who commonly make their promiſes and appointments by the words of their mouthes: in like manner (though the Lord being a ſpirit hath no vſe of mouth, or other corporall members, and being om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, his will carrieth power enough, without the helpe of words) yet for our weake capacity that which he effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally worketh, is imputed to the force of his words, as Mat. 4. 4. <hi>Man ſhall not liue by bread only, but by euery word that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> Lam. 3. 38. <hi>Out of the mouth of

               <p>The fauours here mentioned are, prouiſion and protection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The former whereof is ſet foorth by a ſimilitude from proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent fathers, who take care for their children, and not onely maintaine them with foode, and other neceſſaries, while they are young, but carefully get, and lay vp to make them a ſtock, when they come to age: So, and better dealeth the Lord for his ſonnes and daughters: for whereas men gather corruptible goods for theirs, which many times come to nothing, and they haue no vſe of them, <hi>hee hideth that which is a being</hi> (as the word ſignifieth) for his: they ſhall be ſure to enioy the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it; the treaſures of grace, ioy, and glorie, are ſafely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued for them. The latter is of two ſorts, the one corporall concerning the outward man, as ſafetie from bodily enemies,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26745:15"/> and externall dangers, which is alſo declared by a borrowed ſpeech, he being called a ſhield, that will intercept all noiſome ſtrokes, and practiſes, that none of them ſhall light vpon his people, to hurt them, though for their triall, humilitie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther profitable vſes, they may be afflicted by them. The other is ſpirituall concerning the inward man, as ſafetie from ſinne, and Satan, and apoſtaſie, that notwithſtanding, by theſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the ſoule, they are in perill either to be miſled through craft, or to bee thruſt out of the right way, through violence, yet they ſhall <hi>keepe the paths of equitie;</hi> they ſhall perſeuere, and proceede in their vertuous courſes. And why? <hi>For he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth their way,</hi> he doth as it were eſtabliſh and gard them in their weldoing by his grace, from the force and power of their owne corruptions, and the diuels temptations, and wicked mens euill counſels, and the worlds allurements, yea hee dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, and by his prouidence proſpereth the purpoſes, words, actions, and the whole courſe of their liues. Now he deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth thoſe, for whom this prouiſion is made, and to whom this protection pertaineth diuerſly: firſt from their truth and ſinceritie, calling them <hi>righteous ones.</hi> Secondly, from their holy conuerſation, that they <hi>walke vprightly.</hi> Thirdly, from their happie eſtate, that they are the <hi>Saints of the Lord:</hi> the deriuation of the Hebrew word importeth ſuch as to whom God ſheweth mercie, and ſo are made alſo godly, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. So much for the cauſe of wiſedome, now follow the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Then ſhalt thou vnderſtand righteouſnes, and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and equitie, and euery good path.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe effect of wiſedome, which hee here beginneth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of, is the vigour and efficacie of it, whereby they are induced and made able to doe that which is good, as theſe words declare, and become circumſpect and cautious to ſhun that which is euill: as will appeare in the ſequell of that which followeth. <hi>Then,</hi> when thou haſt applied thine eares, &amp; heart to wiſedome: when thou haſt called for vnderſtanding: when
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26745:16"/> thou haſt diligently ſought for it, and found it, the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing it vpon thee, then <hi>ſhalt thou vnderstand,</hi> both know, &amp; iuditiouſly exerciſe iuſtice, that which is lawful &amp; right, and iudgement, prudence and good diſcretion, and equity, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and plaine dealing, <hi>and euery good path,</hi> all good courſes of righteouſneſſe and religion. And that he meaneth a practicall knowledge, and not an intellectuall onely, it may bee ſeene by conference with other places; as chap. 8. v. 20. <hi>I cauſe to walke in the way of righteouſnes, and in the middest of the paths of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And in the firſt chapter, verſ. 3. <hi>To receiue instruction, to doe wiſely by iustice, and iudgement, and equity.</hi> See more there.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>When wiſedome entreth into thine heart, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge delighteth thy ſoule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>Then ſhall counſell preſerue thee, and vnderstanding ſhall keepe thee,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>HAuing in few words, but very ſignificant, expreſſed the force of wiſedom in conducting &amp; inabling men to that which is good; he is now about to declare the vertues of it, for conſeruation againſt that which is euill: it is by a borrowed manner of ſpeech, or figure which we call <hi>Proſopopeia,</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a watch or guard, ſuch as Princes and great men are wont to haue about them for the ſafety of their perſons; and therefore it is ſemblably ſaid in the eleuenth verſe, (contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſumme of all) that <hi>counſell ſhall preſerue thee, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding ſhall keepe them;</hi> their ſoules ſhall be as ſafe by the power thereof, as the bodies of thoſe which haue a band of armed men to waite vpon them. Heereunto in the tenth verſe he maketh a paſſage, by teaching him that would receiue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from wiſedome, how he muſt be prepared for it: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the twelfth, and thoſe that follow, hee ſpecifieth the principall hurtfull things from which hee ſhall bee prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. In the preparation are two things required; firſt, that <hi>Wiſedome</hi> come not into the head only, ſo as it be vnderſtood, or may be diſcourſed of; but <hi>into the heart,</hi> to ſeaſon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26745:16"/> and that it be ſingularly loued, which wil produce this effect, that <hi>knowledge ſhall delight the ſoule,</hi> be pleaſant vnto it, as beautifull ſights are to the eyes, according to the proper ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the word; or as meate and drinke are to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and thirſtie, or any thing which we relliſh well, in which ſenſe the word is alſo ſomtimes vſed, as Prou. 9. 17. <hi>His bread is pleaſant, &amp;c.</hi> The hurtfull things from which wiſedome will defend a man, are of two ſorts; ſome are reall, or actuall, as <hi>the euill way,</hi> wicked behauiour, ſinfull attempts, exorbitant cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: ſome are perſonall, as meanes and cauſes of the former, and theſe mentioned in the latter ſtreame of the twelfth verſe, and more fully in thoſe that next enſue it.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 12. <hi>And from the man that ſpeaketh peruerſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>SAlomon</hi> hath ſhewed the actuall euill, the wicked courſe of life, from which the louers of wiſedome ſhall bee ſhiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And now hee proceedeth to promiſe them ſafety alſo from the means thereof, ſuch peſtilent perſons as vſe to entice and corrupt others:</p>

               <p>Both which hee deſcribeth at large, firſt the men, and them by ſundry effects, wherof each one as it were by ſteps ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth an other: the firſt is their ſpeech, that they <hi>ſpeake peruerſe things,</hi> tending to the diſhonour of God, and the peruerting of men, as the root and originall of the word importeth.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 13. <hi>And from them that leaue the paths of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to walke in the paths of darkeneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe ſecond effect of wicked men is their behauiour, and deeds; (for ill ſpeaking is euer accompanied with ill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) and theſe are ſet forth by an oppoſition, or compariſon of contraries, whereby their courſe of life is made more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>they for ſake the paths of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:26745:17"/> which are alſo the pathes of light, <hi>to walke in the pathes of darkeneſſe,</hi> which are the waies of ignorance and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; as if he ſhould haue ſaid, they turne from the right way of knowledge and obedience, which leadeth to ſaluation, and trauell in the waies of ſinne towards deſtruction: and their fault herein is ſo much the fouller, in that they goe not aſtray by meere error, or infirmity of their nature, as if they could not learne, or neuer were directed to a better way; but againſt their knowledge, and contrary to the light, they wilfully ſhun that good courſe which is approued of God, and conforme themſelues to the will of Satan, and practiſe that which they would neuer haue examined by the rule of the word: for the ſhine thereof would diſcouer the hideouſneſſe of it, and make it appeare to be odious and lothſome.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 14. <hi>Which reioyce in doing euill, and delight in wicked frowardneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe third property and effect of theſe wicked men, is the diſorder of their affections, whereby they aggrauate and much encreaſe the naughtineſſe of their words and actions; for they not onely <hi>doe euill,</hi> but reioyce therein: they come to it with deſire, they practiſe it with pleaſure, and afterwards are glad of their helliſh exploits; yea they exult, as the other word ſignifieth, they expreſſe that delight which they haue taken in ſatisfying their luſts, either by geſture, or countenance, or vaunting, or by ſome meanes or other, and many of them glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moſt of that, whereof they ought to bee moſt aſhamed, as <hi>in wicked frowardneſſe;</hi> the word is <hi>peruerſeneſſe of euill,</hi> ſinfull headineſſe in their licentious attempts whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 15. <hi>Whoſe waies are peruerſe, and they are obstinate in their pathes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe laſt effect and property of the ſinful miſcreants, is their deſperate incorrigibleneſſe, that albeit their waies bee peruerſe, and all their courſe and carriage bee leaud and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:26745:17"/> yet they are refractarie in them, and reſolued neuer to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, but grow worſe like reſty iades, that are ſtill going backwards, when they ſhould proceed in a iourney. Neither will they hearken to him that ſhall teach them by precept, nor yet be willing to follow him that ſhall lead them by example, but are euery way ſo auerſe and froward, that their Miniſter or beſt friends can haue no hope or heart to deale any further with them, but may leaue them with a ſigh as men incurable; as the Phyſitian doth him that hath the pangs of death vpon him, or the Surgeon ſuch a one as is thruſt thorow the heart. They are the ſame whom in the former chapter hee calleth ſcorners, which would none of wiſedomes counſell, but deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her correction, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 16. <hi>It ſhall deliuer thee from the ſtrange woman, from the ſtranger that flattereth with her words.</hi>

               <p>NOw followeth the ſecond ſort of perillous perſons, from which, wiſedome will defend the men that loue her: ſhe will deliuer them from the euill woman, from the adultereſſe, and all her enticements, with the fruit and end thereof. And</p>

So, other fire then that which God fent downe from heauen vpon the altar, and was there conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually nouriſhed, was called ſtrange fire; then ſhe is ſaid to be a ſtranger, to be reputed as a forreiner, that hath alienated her ſelfe from God and his people, by her filthy conuerſation. As therefore the Iſraelites might not marrie with women that were aliens, as being the daughters of ſtrange gods; no more ought a member of Chriſt to haue company with an harlot, as being as it were of another nation, not ſanctified to the Lord;

               <p>Some part of her misbehauiour is mentioned in this verſe, as her ſmooeh and flattering ſpeech, whereby ſhe laboureth to allure vnwarie and heedleſſe perſons, and them with a baite to bring into her net.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 17. <hi>Which forſaketh the guide of her youth, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the couenant of her God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HEre haue we declared vnto vs the effects of this ſtrange woman, her diſloyaltie and perfidious behauiour, both againſt her husband and the Lord. <hi>She forſaketh</hi> her husband both in affection and action, though not perhaps in bodily preſence, as <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife, and the harlot mentioned hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſeuenth chapter had not: neither do all, nor the moſt, but few of them vtterly refuſe their husbands bed; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhe liue and lie with him, yet ſhe is ſaid to relinquiſh him, if ſhe keepe not her ſelfe to him onely, and hee enioy her wholly. Now to aggrauate the hainouſneſſe of the offence, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> deſcribeth the husband ſo wronged, by his office and authority, and giueth the title of guide, adding withall a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to make the fault appeare the fouler, that hee <hi>is the guide of her youth;</hi> euen he whom ſhe firſt loued, to whom ſhee firſt gaue her heart, and hand, and whom God had appointed to her as an head and gouernour, euen when ſhee was young and had moſt need of direction. Then her ſinne againſt God is ſet out, in that ſhe hath broken her faith plighted in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and at the marriage, and ſo is periured, and that againſt the Lord, whoſe couenant this was; not onely for that he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained marriage to be entred into by ſuch bonds and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but becauſe it was ratified, ſanctified, and eſtabliſhed by his ſpecial preſence, &amp; with ſpeciall inuocation vpon his name.</p>

               <p>IN this Chapter the ſpirit of God proceedeth to perſwade his people to the conſcionable obſeruation, and keeping</p>

               <p>And the moſt of theſe are promiſes, yea all of them to the ſeuen and twentieth verſe, and ſo after the thirtieth; yet amplified by their contraries, as will appeare in their places.</p>
               <p>The exhortations are of two ſorts: one is generall, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an exact care of al Gods law: the others are more ſpecial, containing an vnfolded declaration of ſundrie duties.</p>
               <p>The firſt we haue in theſe firſt words, wherein we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, firſt, the perſons to whom hee ſpeaketh. Secondly, the counſell which he deliuereth.</p>
               <p>The perſons, are all faithfull readers, or hearers, to whom without partialaty he directeth his ſpeech, as if it were but one
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:26745:20"/> man, and he moſt deare vnto him, and therfore as afore, ſo now againe, and afterwards, he vſeth the amiable name of a <hi>ſonne;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, It is not an enemie that dealeth with thee, nor a bare friend, nor a maſter to his ſeruant, nor a King to his ſubiect, but a father to his childe: whether therefore thou look to God the author, he loueth thee tenderly that ſpeaketh vnto thee, hearken therefore with attention, and obey. His counſell is vttered, firſt, in a prohibition, <hi>forget not my law,</hi> neither ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my doctrine to ſlip out of thy memory, neither be vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to put it in practiſe: then by a precept, <hi>but let thy heart keepe my commandements,</hi> get ſound knowledge of them, and embrace them with vprightnes, and good affection.</p>
               <p>Verſe 2. <hi>For they ſhall adde vnto thee length of daies, and yeeres of life, and peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe generall precept for faithfull keeping of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements hath an ample promiſe annexed vnto it of a long life, and comfortable eſtate. <hi>For they,</hi> wiſedomes law and precept remembred, and obeyed, <hi>ſhall adde vnto thee length of daies:</hi> he meaneth not that the termes, and times which the Lord hath ſet ſhall be lengthened, but as hee hath prefined a long life to any of his people, ſo hath he ordained it to be the reward of their obedience. <hi>And peace,</hi> welfare, and proſperity, ſo farre as is ſafe and good for thee, and corrupteth not thy heart with pride, vaine confidence, forgetfulnes of God, and death, and immoderate loue of the world. If any man except againſt theſe words as vntrue, or improbable, becauſe many good men liue in trouble, and dye in their youth, let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the obedience of the godly is not full, but in part, and therefore it is no marueile, if in part onely they are made partakers of outward things: and hereunto adde that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes touching outward things are not abſolute, and ſimple, but conditionall, and the Lord giuing his children in heauen eternitie, and complete happineſſe, doth verifie all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes with aduantage. And it pleaſeth him many waies reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their good, to ſhorten the race of diuers whom he deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26745:20"/> loueth. Sometimes, leſt they ſhould bee corrupted in the world, as that ſeemeth to bee one cauſe why <hi>Ieroboams</hi> good<note place="margin">1. King. 14. 11.</note> ſonne was taken away ſo ſoone. Sometimes leſt they ſhould ſee the euils to come: and therefore that worthie <hi>Ioſiah</hi> was<note place="margin">Iſai. 57. 1. 2.</note> called to his reſt before the calamities that ſhortly after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. Sometimes the wicked world vnworthie of them and vnkind vnto them, is iuſtly puniſhed by hauing them taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 3. 8.</note> from them. And for all this, notwithſtanding they liue neuer ſo ſhort a time, yet haue they the <hi>length of daies,</hi> euery day being a whole day vnto them, the Sunne of comfort, and of Gods fauour ariſing vpon them early in the morning, and ſhining vpon them brighter and brighter without any going downe. Sommer fruite may be as ripe as the winter fruite, and yet gathered many weekes, or ſome moneths before it.</p>
               <p>Verſe 3. <hi>Let not mercie and truth forſake thee: binde them an thy necke, and write them vpon the table of thy heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFter the generall precept, he preſcribeth eſpeciall duties, yet ſuch as are of large extent, and containe vnder them very many particulars: for by <hi>mercie</hi> he meaneth all good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices towards man; and by <hi>truth,</hi> faith, or faithfulnes, he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth all good duties which wee owe to God. Which appeareth to bee ſo, becauſe theſe being propounded in this verſe are handled more at large in the chapter, the latter in the former place, and the former in the ſecond, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Hebrewes. Now theſe graces he requireth as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be kept, as prouidently gotten, admoniſhing that they <hi>forſake vs not,</hi> ſpeaking by an hypallagy, he giueth vs a caueat, that we forſake not them, and withall noteth how readie they are (through our corruption) to bee gone from vs. And the great difficultie of retaining them, and therefore in the next words he requireth that we ſhould <hi>binde them to our necks,</hi> that is, looke well to them, and keepe them ſafe, and tye them faſt, as men doe their chaines, or coſtly Iewels which they vſe for their delight, and ornaments: and withall to <hi>write them on the table of our heart,</hi> that is, alway to remember them, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:26745:21"/> thinke on them, ſpeake of them, and doe them, as we vſe to ſet downe in our tables thoſe things whereof we would keepe a preciſe memorandum.</p>
               <p>Verſe 4. <hi>So ſhalt thou finde fauour, and good vnderſtanding in the ſight of God, and man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THe former precept hath this promiſe annexed vnto it for a reaſon: wherein two things are promiſed: the firſt is, that by obſeruation of that holy aduice, or commandement, a man ſhall <hi>finde,</hi> that is, obtaine comfort, <hi>fauour,</hi> loue, liking, and good acceptatio: the other is, he ſhall finde <hi>good vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> whereby is meant good ſucceſſe, or any ſuch bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, whereby vnderſtanding is rewarded: for heere is the cauſe put for the effect. And both theſe are ſaid to bee <hi>before God, and man,</hi> that is, God will be gracious to ſuch, and man will bee friendly. God will giue them the fruite, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their vnderſtanding, and cauſe their good eſtate to teſtifie their wiſedome, euen ſuch as hee doth approoue of, and man ſhall be witneſſe of the ſame. Where now may be ſeene how pertinently the promiſe performed doth anſwere to the precept obeyed. He that by the truth is ſeruiceable to God, and likewiſe by mercie is profitable to man, ſhall <hi>finde fauour</hi> and honour both with God, and man.</p>
               <p>Verſe 5. <hi>Truſt in the Lord with all thine heart, and leane not to thine owne wiſedome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAuing in the precept laſt before, commended to vs the conſtant poſſeſſion, or rather vs vnto the faithfull cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of <hi>mercie,</hi> and thereby all righteouſnes required in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table, and <hi>truth,</hi> the quinteſſence of the firſt he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with the latter, declaring certaine particuler duties, and benefits of pietie, to the ſeuen and twentieth verſe, and then intreateth of the former. In the firſt place hee perſwadeth to truſt and put confidence in God, which is a reſting, and repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſelues on him, and his fatherly prouidence, both for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:26745:21"/> deliuerance from all euill things, and the fruition of all good things needfull for vs touching this life, and that to come. And hereof hee preſcribeth the manner, that it bee with the whole heart, conſtant, ſtable, firme, and well fixed, without wauering or diffidence: for he would not haue his ſufficiencie or fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be ſuſpected, or called into queſtion. Neither is this all, but much heed muſt alſo be taken that the heart bee not diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, partly depending vpon the Lord, and hoping for helpe from him, and partly relying vpon other meanes, and putting affiance in them. Loue is communicable to creatures, ſo that it be in an inferiour place, and feare alſo if it bee ſubordinate to the feare of him, &amp; agreeable to his ordinance; but confidence is annexed to his imperial crown, and reſerued peculiarly vnto himſelfe. And therfore he ſetteth it forth here by the contrary, oppoſing vnto it ones owne wiſedome; that is to ſay, wit and policie, whereby a man is able to ſhift, and make prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for himſelfe in all caſes; and naming one fleſhly ſtay, hee meaneth all of like nature, as wealth, worthineſſe, ſtrength, friends and innumerable others, more then can perticularly be recounted. And his admonition is, that we <hi>leane not</hi> vnto that one, or any of the reſt, taking the ſimilitude from aged, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent perſons, who commit the weight of their bodies to the ſtrength of their ſtaffe; if it bee ſound and ſtrong enough, they are vpholden by it, and ſtand faſt; if it be rotten, crackt, or too ſmall, they fall to the ground with the breach of the ſame: or from houſes or edifices which are ſupported by pillars, which being firme, doe beare vp the roofe and whole building; but they being weake and inſufficient, downe commeth all. And ſuch is the ſtate of thoſe which either vtterly renounce all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance in God, &amp; betake themſelues wholly to worldly helpes, or elſe truſt that hee will eſtabliſh them on the one ſide, and their owne props made of reeds and wheat ſtrawes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly vphold them on the other. It is as good for a foundation to bee laid altogether on the ſand, as partly on the ſand, and partly on a rocke; and an houſe to bee without buttraſſes on both ſides, if it haue nothing to ſuſtaine it, but ruinous walles on the one.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:26745:22"/>
               <p>Verſe 6. <hi>In all thy waies acknowledge him, and he ſhall direct thy waies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VNto truſt he requireth knowledge to be adioyned, which is the vnderſtanding, and apprehenſion of his will, and of his word, and this is declared by the vſe and exerciſe of it, and that by the ſubiects, and thoſe by their extent and larg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>s. The exerciſe of knowledge is an acknowledgement that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion be made of him, with ſeruice done vnto him. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects thereof are the waies of men, the whole paſſage of their life, their actions which they performe, the words which they vtter, and the cogitations which they conceiue. The extent of the ſame is expreſſed by the note of vniuerſalitie, <hi>all:</hi> nothing is to bee done, nothing is to be ſpoken, nothing is to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined or thought of, contrary to the rules thereof. To this hee addeth a ſecond argument, taken from the benefit and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous euent of this knowing and acknowledging of him, <hi>he ſhall direct thy workes,</hi> and thy words, and purpoſes, by him thou ſhall be informed what is lawfull, and what is vnlawfull, what is holy, and what is ſinfull, what is vſefull, and what is hurtfull, what is moſt ſeaſonable, and what is out of ſeaſon: by him thy heart ſhall bee inclined to make choice of that which is beſt, and to refuſe that which is vnfitting: by him thou ſhalt be aſſiſted to performe thy actions, and vtter thy ſpeeches in ſuch manner, as ſhall be moſt acceptable to him, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thy ſelfe and others.</p>
               <p>Verſe 7. <hi>Be not wiſe in thine owne eyes, but feare the Lord, and depart from euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Third precept hee giueth to feare the Lord, which is to ſubiect thy ſelfe vnto him, and to ſtand in reuerent awe of him: for his truth, iuſtice, greatnes, goodnes, omniſcience, and vbiquitie: and becauſe of his holy word, his glorious acts and righteous iudgement. And hereunto he maketh a way by remouall of that which is againſt it, and an impediment vnto
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:26745:22"/> it, which is ſelfe-liking. <hi>Be not wiſe in thine owne eyes:</hi> that is, bee not conceited, and haue no opinion of thine owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. It is a borrowed ſpeech, wherein the eſtimation of the minde is compared to the aſpects of the ſteare, according to other texts of Scripture. Pſal. 101. 6. <hi>Mine eyes ſhall be to the faithfull of the land:</hi> that is, I will much regard them: and Iſai. 66. verſ. 2. To him will I looke, euen to him that is poore, and of a contrite ſpirit: that is, I will declare my fauour, and good acceptance, and miniſter comfort and helpe to him. Now by this one, he forbiddeth all proud thoughts, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of ones ſelfe, for what reſpect ſoeuer. For an hie minde, and loftie conceit of a mans owne excellencie will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer agree with the true feare of God, which is euermore ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the ſight of thine owne vilenes. And this grace he ſetteth notably foorth by a worthie effect of it, <hi>the departure from euill,</hi> and that conſiſteth partly in auoiding the baites of it, that wee bee not inſnared therewith, and fall into it: and partly in breaking off ſinne (wherein we haue formerly liued) by ſound repentance, and reformation: and ſetting it downe indefinitly hee vnderſtandeth all kinde of wickedneſſe, as of heart, of act, of tongue, of any ſenſe, of any member, and is the ſame in ſenſe with that which the Apoſtle expreſſeth in other termes, <hi>Let vs clenſe our ſelues from all filthineſſe of fleſh, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſ. 8. <hi>So ſhall health bee to thy nauell, and marrow to thy<note place="margin">Shikkui.</note> bones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THis promiſe is added, not onely to the precept immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately foregoing it; but to thoſe alſo in the fifth and ſixth verſes, which require an abſolute dependance on the Lord, as this laſt doth an holy dread of him, with a diſclaime of their owne wiſedome, and an abandoning of all vitious behauiour. The reward promiſed is a good and comfortable eſtate, if not conſpicuouſly maintained with great plenty, and abundance, yet ſecretly, and in an hidden and extraordinary manner nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:26745:23"/> with effectuall ſufficiencie. And this he alligorically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth to the condition of an infant, which in the wombe receiueth nouriſhment at the nauell, whereby it enioyeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of life, breath, health, and growth; &amp; after it is borne by the milke which it ſucketh, and the food that is miniſtred vnto it; the bones are repleniſhed with moiſtneſſe, that is, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row (by a metaphor taken from the moiſture of the earth, which feedeth the roots of plants with nouriture, and they the ſtocke, or ſtemme, and branches, with ſap.)</p>
               <p>This marrow of the bones proueth the body to be in health, and good liking; as <hi>Iob</hi> deſcribeth the welfare of a man by the ſame note, ſaying, <hi>His breasts are full of milke, and his bones run</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 21. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>full of marrow.</hi> And this ſimilitude very aptly befitteth the matter in hand, and preuenteth ſuch exceptions as fleſhly men might take againſt the former precepts. For if we nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie on our wiſedome, but vtterly relinquiſh the eſtimation of it (ſaith carnall reaſon) how can we poſſibly auoide penurie? For men would ſoone bee ſtarued for all their faith and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if they had no forecaſt to relieue themſelues withall. Which thing corrupt ſenſe alſo ſeemeth to confirme, and vpbraideth vs with the pouerty and need of many, which will not liue by their wits, nor bee opinionate thereof, which will not ſhift for themſelues indirectly, <hi>but doe feare the Lord, and depart from euill.</hi> Doe not we ſee (ſaith it) diuers of them quite deſtitute of lands, or liuing, ſtocke, or ſtore, or any thing before hand to keepe themſelues and their families? what be they the better for their humility, deuotion, and mortification? The fallacie of both theſe, as well of ſenſeleſſe ſenſe, as of vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable reaſon is detected, and confuted of the holy Ghoſt by this elegant ſimilitude. What wiſedome or policie hath the babe new borne to make ſhift for it ſelfe? and yet the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of it thriueth as well as the thrifty husbands ſpoken of in the Goſpell; and who looketh to the child in the wombe? or<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> what ſubſtance hath it lying by to maintaine it? Nay, it hath not ſo much as the vſe of a mouth to receiue meate, or milke, if any hand, or breaſt could miniſter the ſame vnto it: and yet
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:26745:23"/> the rich mans great barnes full of corne did not better relieue him, then Gods prouidence, or ordinance doth this poore em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brion.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 9. <hi>Honour the Lord with thy riches, and with the chiefe of thy reuenues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HAuing propoſed certaine of the principall parts of piety, as confidence in God, &amp;c. he teacheth euery man how to beſtow and employ the ſame in any condition of life, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he ſhall finde himſelfe either bleſſed, or croſſed by the hand of the Lord; and therefore in this verſe teacheth him how to vſe proſperity; and in the next ſaue one, how to beare aduerſity. Touching the former, he commandeth to <hi>honour the Lord with his riches;</hi> not only by diſcharging ſuch leuies, rates, and neceſſarie dues as are required at his hands, for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his miniſtery, and the meanes of his ſeruice; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by a franke and free contribution, for the furtherance of true religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Gods holy worſhip, as they were bound to pay tithes, and firſt fruites, and taught to bring free-will offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, &amp; voluntarie oblations. Now the things to be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted he ſetteth forth, firſt, by the quality, that they be not things vile, baſe, and of no value, and as it were the refuſe of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but the choyce, chiefe and principall thereof: the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of which is commended in <hi>Abel,</hi> whom <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported<note place="margin">Gen. 4. 4.</note> to haue offered of the fat of the cattell: and the default hereof is much taxed in the Iewes by <hi>Malachy,</hi> ſaying: <hi>You offer vncleane bread on my altar; and ye ſay, Wherein haue we pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mal. 17. 8. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>thee? In that ye ſay, The table of the Lord is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. And if ye offer the blood for a ſacrifice, is it not euill? and if ye offer the lame, and ſicke, is it not euill? offer it to thy Prince, will he be content with it, ſaith the Lord of hosts? But curſed be the deceiuer, which hath in his flocke a male, and offereth to the Lord a corrupt thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by the generality of kinds, that they dedicate to God part of all their profits, whether it be of the croppe of the ground, or of the fruites of the trees, or of the cattell of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:26745:24"/> flocke, or of whatſoeuer other commodities doe accrew vnto them. And though riches be onely here ſpecified, yet are all other endowments to the ſame purpoſe to bee deſtinated, and after the ſame manner to be vſed; as credit, authority, ſtrength, knowledge, eloquence, cunning, and other good gifts both of grace and nature.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>So ſhall thy barnes be filled with abundance, and thy wine preſſe runne ouer with new wine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANd becauſe God cannot bee well honoured with riches without charges, and no charges preſſe a carnall heart ſo hard as thoſe that are beſt expended; hee therefore encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vs to beſtow this coſt, and that with a promiſe of greater gaine, which he hyperbolically amplifieth, &amp; with an holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue kind of ſpeech: his meaning is, that we ſhall be ſo farre from being impoueriſhed by this coſt, as that contrariwiſe we ſhall bee enriched by the ſame, the bleſſing of God being ſo great vpon our labour, as that wee ſhall haue as much corne as our barnes and granaries can containe; and wine in ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as that our wine preſſes, tubs, and other veſſels ſhall run ouer with plentie, or all other commodities proportionable and equiualent vnto thoſe two. And though theſe things ſhould faile to riſe to ſuch a quantity; yet this promiſe doth neuer faile of verity and truth, for as much as leſſe meaſure of earthly poſſeſſions may oftentimes be of greater vſe, and much more for comfort and contentment. The wiſedome of God ſeeth in this argument a pregnancie, and aptneſſe to induce men to obey the exhortation: and therefore he putteth it as a forcible weapon into the hand of faith, for the ſuppreſſion and keeping vnder of diffidence, which cauſeth ſo much grudging and reſtrainedneſſe, moſt men thinking all to bee loſt that is well beſtowed: whereas if they could apprehend, and foreſee the gaine that will redound vnto them, and the profit they ſhal receiue, they would eſteeme benificence, and large expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces diſcreetly laid out for good vſes, to bee the chiefe point of thrift, and all good husbandrie: and they may well know, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:26745:24"/> when their barnes, wine preſſes, ſhops, ſtore-houſes, chambers, coffers, treaſuries, fields and paſtures are repleniſhed with all ſtore, plenty, and furniture belonging ſeuerally vnto them; yet they haue not therein attained vnto the fulneſſe of their wealth, nor beſt of their ſubſtance. For theſe earthly riches are promiſed and giuen onely as pledges and pawnes of more worthfull poſſeſſions, euen celeſtiall treaſures, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 11. 12. <hi>My ſonne, deſpiſe not the chastening of the Lord, neither be weary of his correction. For whom the Lord lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, he correcteth, euen as a father the ſonne in whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth.</hi>

               <p>WE haue ſeene how, and for what cauſe God is to bee ſerued in the ſtate of proſperity, whence hee paſſeth to another point, teaching vs ſubmiſſiuely, and patiently to yeeld to his words, and the ſtripes of his hands in the ſtate of aduerſitie. And this he doth by way of a (<hi>Prolepſis</hi>) after this manner. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Notwithſtanding all the wealth, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance with other kindes, and degrees of felicitie promiſed to them that feare the Lord, and dedicate themſelues, and that which they haue vnto his ſeruice; yet experience ſheweth that none are more afflicted with pouertie, and other croſſes, then ſuch as are moſt deuoted to him, being willing to depart with any thing for his ſake. <hi>Anſw.</hi> We finde this to be true indeed, in all ages and places it ſo falles out; howbeit the afflictions which they ſuſtaine are not puniſhments comming from the wrath of God to their hurt, but chaſtizements from his loue, and laid vpon them for their good: whereupon he exhorteth to beare them accordingly, deliuering a precept, and backing the ſame with reaſons. The precept containeth two rules mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitorie, directed to the ſonnes of wiſedome, which are fruitfull readers, attentiue hearers, and embracers of her: the firſt is, that <hi>they deſpiſe not correction,</hi> viz. that they make not light account of it, as they doe who will not take notice of any ſtrokes, or iudgements that light vpon them; or if they bee
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:26745:25"/> touched with the feeling thereof, they impute the ſame either to fortune or deſtinie, or aſcribe all to inferiour and ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cauſes, and turne their eyes from beholding the hand of him that ſtriketh, and from the ſight of their owne ſins, which by due deſert haue cauſed themſelues to be ſmitten: and as they doe who (notwithſtanding they feele the ſmart of the rod, and cannot but ſee the iuſtice of God therein) are yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſenſeleſſe and obdurate, without godly ſorrow, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out godly ſhame, without godly feare, and without all godly remorſe and humiliation: and as they doe who ſeeme to bee ſomewhat affrighted, and for a time deiected with griefe, and humilitie, yet proceed not to reformation of their vicious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour: and as they who in extremitie of miſerie reforme ſome part of their misbehauiour, and ſeeme for a time peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and very contrite for their offences; yet when the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie is paſſed ouer, and they are freed from puniſhment and perill, they returne like the dogge to his vomit, and liue as impiouſly, as impurely, and as vnrighteouſly, as euer they did in former time: ſo then this is to deſpiſe correction, not to bee bettered by it, by making ſome good and profitable vſe of it.</p>
               <p>The other rule is, to auoide another extremitie of being <hi>wearie of his correction,</hi> viz. when men be diſcouraged at their afflictions, when they languiſh and faint vnder the burthen of them: for that produceth many pernitious effects, thereby they are diſabled from all good ſeruices, they cannot be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious in their ſeuerall callings with any cheerefulnes: they cannot pray with any comfort, they cannot giue thankes to God with any ioyfulnes: they cannot embrace the word with good attention, nor meditate in it with any delight. We reade in Exodus that the Lord ſent a gracious meſſage vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaying, <hi>I will take you for my people, and will be your God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 6. 7. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>and you ſhall know that I the Lord your God will bring you from the burthens of the Egyptians. And I will bring you into the land, which I ſware I would giue to Abraham, and to Iſaac, and to Iacob, and will giue it you for a poſſeſſion: So Moſes told the children of Iſrael thus:</hi> but with what ſucceſſe, the ſame text
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:26745:25"/> telleth vs, <hi>they hearkened not to voyces for anguiſh of ſpirit, and cruell bondage.</hi> Hence proceede diſtempers, paſſions, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, grieuous concluſions of men againſt themſelues: as that God abhorreth them, as damnable hypocrites, reprobates, and caſt awayes: that there will neuer be an end of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and troubles, that they ſhall not be able to beare them long, but fall downe vnder them with deſperation. Hence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds indirect ſeeking of helpe, vntimely, and vnconſcionably, and after a ſhifting manner. Such euents are not onely ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in theſe dayes, but haue bin ancient in former times, and that amongſt the deareſt of Gods owne ſeruants, ſuch as were <hi>Iob,</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> whoſe diſcouraged hearts, drew their<note place="margin">Iob 3. 3. Ier. 2. 14.</note> tongues to paſſionate ſpeeches, curſing the day of their birth, and the news tellers thereof, with ſundry imprecations againſt themſelues, and their innocent friends: and as were the afflicted Saints in the time of the Prophets complaining after this ſort: <hi>The Lord hath forſaken me, and my God hath forgotten me:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſai. 49. 14. Lam. 3. 8.</note> and after this, <hi>My ſtrength and mine hope is periſhed from the Lord.</hi> And as was <hi>Dauids</hi> crying out in his haſte, that <hi>all men were lyars,</hi> ſeeming to taxe <hi>Samuel</hi> amongſt the reſt, that there was no truth in any, no not in him, nor euen then when in the name of the Lord hee aſſured him of their kingdome. And therefore in his diſtruſtfulnes concluding that at one time or other, he ſhould dye by the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> he fled out of Iſrael into Paleſtina, from the Church of God to the heathen, where he was driuen to miſerable perplexity, to ſhew diuers vncome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">1. Sam. 21. 11.</note> tricks, and to play ſuch parts as were altogether vnſeemely for his profeſſion, place and perſon. The reaſons whereby he inciteth men to indure afflictions without contempt, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, are two: the firſt is, the principall efficient, the Lord himſelfe, who is to be feared in the leaſt of his workes: yea in his word, and who hath a whole forreſt of rods to ſcourge vs withall, if we profit not by fewer, or ſmaller; which if we well conſidered, we would ſtoope at the leaſt, and feare at the firſt ſhaking of his hand at vs. For to contemne his chaſtiſements is to deſpiſe himſelfe, and to cauſe him to loſe his labour in nurtering of vs. For we eſteeme it a ſigne of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:26745:26"/> graceleſneſſe for a childe beaten by his father not to ſhed teares, ſo farre as oft times it draweth teares from his fathers eyes: euen ſo much more it argueth want of grace in vs, if we melt not when we are corrected by God himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon, and that which is to confirme the heart with patience, is the mouing cauſe, together with the formall, the fauour and goodneſſe of God inducing him to inflict cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, that hee bee not driuen to execute vengeance and puniſhments. And this is cleered by a compariſon of the like dealing of a father with his childe, who doth not beate his ſonne to kill him, but to correct him: not to breake a legge, or an arme, but his ſtubborne hart: not to make him runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but to cauſe him to returne to a better minde, and to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter behauiour: and in a word, not becauſe hee hateth him, but becauſe he beareth a ſingular loue vnto him.</p>

               <p>FOr the performance of the former duties hee preſcribeth the moſt effectuall meanes, <hi>viz.</hi> the vertue, and knowledge of Gods holy word, which hee calleth by the name of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the commendation whereof hee ſetteth foorth by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie arguments, and illuſtrations. And in the firſt place he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a large, and notable effect, the confluence and marrow of many effects, the felicitie, and happie eſtate of thoſe vpon whom it is conferred. And this hee declareth by an <hi>Epiphone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> or acclamation, to the end to rauiſh our mindes with the excellencie of it. <hi>Bleſſed is the man</hi> (ſaith he) oh how bleſſed is the man that findeth true wiſedome, which diſcerneth what it is, and wherein it conſiſteth, and accordingly valueth it as a thing moſt admirable, rare, and precious: <hi>and the man that getteth vnderſtanding,</hi> which by diligent trauaile in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and profitable vſe of Gods ſacred miniſterie obtaineth ſoundnes of iudgement, vprightnes of heart, and a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as farre as he is able to conforme himſelfe to the will of the Lord, in beleeuing his promiſes, and obeying his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.

               <p>HE maketh good his poſition by compariſons: firſt, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically equalizing wiſedome with gainfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: it is not like to dead ſtuffe, or wares which will lie vpon a chapmans hand without vent, or vtterance, but it is a merchandize that is vendible, and as good as readie money. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The firſt is ſiluer: the ſecond is gold better then that: the third pretious ſtones, which are richer then both, and addeth a fourth more generall, and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the former, and all other things of like ſort, whatſoeuer is deſirable, or men can ſet their hearts vpon. For God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth theſe treaſures vpon his enemies, and wiſdome vpon his friends, and children only: theſe treaſures are of earthly matter, but wiſedome is celeſtiall and heauenly: theſe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are vncertaine and of no continuance; but wiſedome is conſtant, and euerlaſting: theſe treaſures are many times hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and pernitious both to ſoule and body; but wiſedome onely vſefull and profitable: theſe treaſures are fugitiue, and leaue a man at his death, when he hath moſt need of comfort; but wiſedome then ſtandeth to him, and miniſtreth then moſt conſolation to his conſcience: theſe treaſures procure no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour before the iudgement ſeate of God; but wiſedome bringeth then acceptation and glorie.</p>

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:26745:29"/>
               <p>Touching the firſt, it is ſaid that <hi>the Lord by wiſedom foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the earth:</hi> vnder which hee comprehendeth the ſeas alſo. Which kinde of ſpeech he vſeth, not becauſe hee hath laid any thing vnder the earth, as a foundation or ground-worke, whereupon it is ſuſtained like other buildings: (for it hangeth vpon nothing) but to note the ſure and ſtable ſtanding of it, as if it had a foundation anſwerable to the building.</p>
               <p>Touching the ſecond he ſaith, <hi>by vnderſtanding</hi> (and as the word ſignifieth) aptly, and trimly frameth, and likewiſe makes firme, and ſure, and ſafe from periſhing, and conſtant in the courſes, and reuolutions of the ſtarrie moueable ſpheres, ſo long as the world endureth, the <hi>heauens,</hi> whereby he meaneth that that is ouer vs, the celeſtiall bodies, motions, and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and beneath theſe, all the regions of the aire.</p>
               <p>Touching the third, it is ſaid, <hi>By his knowledge the depths are broken vp,</hi> that is, he claue the depths, made the fountaines that runne along within the earth, to cleaue aſunder, and to breake foorth of the bowels of the earth, and to runne in the channels of the ſame, and the ſame iſſuing out of the entrailes of the earth, haue alſo fit currents for their courſes vpon the earth: for wee may ſee what meete and conuenient diſcents are ordained for them from dales to valleys, and from valleys to valleys, from well heads they haue gutters to conuey them to ſmall brookes, and the ſmaller brookes runne in rilles, and the rilles paſſe out into greater riuers, and the great riuers haue a ready paſſage prepared for them to flow into the Sea; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome places would be turned into bogges or fennes, and made vnfruitfull; others would be drowned vp, and made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable, and few or none would be ſo commodious for men, and other creatures, as now they are.</p>
               <p>Touching the laſt, hee ſaith, <hi>The clowds drop downe dew:</hi> whereby he meaneth raine, and other falling moyſture of all ſorts, which are vapours aſcending out of the earth, to the end that being diſtilled in the aire, they might returne againe with greater vertue to water the ground. And this is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable for the manner, that it commeth moderatly with drops, and not exceſſiuely with ſtreames: if he ſhould open the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:26745:30"/> of heauen, and let it guſh downe, as hee did in <hi>Noah:</hi> time, it would drowne vp, and deſtroy all; but trickling down in this milde ſort, is comfortable for men, and beaſts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for corne, graſſe, herbes, trees, and all kinde of plants both for their growth and fruitfulnes. Thus God is magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his workes of creation, conſeruation, and prouidence, that each of thoſe is done by his wiſedome, and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to ſhew his Alſufficiencie in performing his promiſe to them that embrace his wiſedome.</p>

               <p>Next affirmatiuely, <hi>keepe,</hi> viz. marke, and remember, ſet thy delight vpon, and practiſe: let iudgement, memorie, affection, and conſcience retaine <hi>ſound wiſedome,</hi> not humane, vaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, not the deuices of mens braines, which to carnall reaſon ſeeme glorious and excellent, but that which God doth inſpire, and ratifie in his owne holy word; this he calleth

And herein he exhorteth his readers to hearken to his leſſons, and carefully get, keep, and make much of the heauenly wiſedome of God, to the fourteenth verſe. Secondly, he dehorteth from the ſociety and practiſe of wicked men, to the twentieth verſe. Thirdly, he giueth an admonition, not onely to imbrace his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:26745:37"/> but alſo to vſe them to the gouernment of their hearts, ſpeeches, and all manner of behauiour, to the end of the Chapter. And in all theſe hee deliuereth little or nothing by precept, which he doth not alſo approue to them by reaſon.</p>

               <p>ALthough thoſe perſonal reſpects might be of good force to moue them, yet he thinketh it not enough to vrge his owne iuriſdiction, or their duty for loyalty, but produceth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments to ſhew the equity of his demand: as one is the excellency of the matter, which hee doth propoſe vnto them: <hi>I doe giue you a good doctrine,</hi> that which is wholeſome, pleaſant and profitable to an vpright heart: it is not heretical, erronious, ſeditious, wanton, or any infectious or dangerous diſcourſe: it is no common, triuiall, or worthleſſe pamphlet: it is no fancie of mans braine, or ſuperſtitious tradition of fleſh and blood, but that which is ſound and fruitfull, for mind, hart, manners, ſtate and gouernment: I vtter noble and diuine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, which bring preſent conſolation, and inueſteth men with eternall felicity.

And likewiſe on the contrarie ſide, the degrees
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:26745:42"/> of wicked mens courſes and miſeries are alſo intended, albeit they be not expreſſely mentioned: they are like the darkneſſe of an euening, which waxeth blacker and blacker, euen vntill midnight, whereof it is that they ſhall fall into ſnares, &amp; pits, ſooner, or later, moſt certainly; but where or when they know not. The one ſort therefore begin their iourney at day brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and ſo haue a little mixture of darkneſſe at the firſt, and finiſh it at midday: the other ſet forward about Sun-ſetting, and ſo ſee ſomewhat while it is twilight, and ſtumble on till midnight, and then rather breake their neckes, then come to the end of their iourney.</p>

The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the hart of man (and ſo the whole ſoule, for the which the heart is put (being a moſt noble and principall part of the ſame) is ſubiect to manifold aſſaults and temptations from the diuell, and the world, and to many deceiueable luſts, and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous corruptions within it ſelfe, and therefore chargeth that it be well looked vnto, and kept with watch and ward: and the extent of this heedfulnes hee ſetteth foorth by compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it bee more intenſiue, and ſerious, then any others, then for houſe, then for money, then for bodily ſafetie, then for naturall life: no perill is ſo certaine, as the danger of that: no hurt is ſo fearefull, as the wounding of that: no loſſe is ſo grieuous, as the ſpoyle of that. And therefore to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that he is not ſo earneſt without a cauſe, he rendreth a reaſon for his admonition, <hi>for out of it are the iſſues of life.</hi> All our actions good or bad, proceed from the heart, as the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from whence all the behauiour ſpringeth, and the roote

               <p>VPon the deſcription of an harlot, hee inferreth a two fold admonition, one generall, and the other ſpeciall: the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is to imbrace his words, both with attention, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that men ſhould hearken vnto them, and not turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them; and theſe hee oppoſeth as an antidote vnto her enticing allurements.

The ſpeciall drift is to teach vs that we auoide this wretched harlot, whereby is forbidden not onely all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, diſhoneſt and vnſeemely company with her, gazing on her, talking with her, &amp;c. but all comming neere to her, and as much as we may, her very ſight and preſence: for gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder is no more apt to take fire (if it come neere to it) then our corrupt nature to bee prouoked to this ſinne; and therefore alſo hee would not haue vs to come to <hi>her houſe,</hi> or the place where ſhee is, yea to the very doores of her houſe, becauſe this diſeaſe is ſo dangerous, that the place it ſelfe is full of perill.</p>

               <p>Of the outward, the firſt is the forfeiture of a mans honour and dignity, which the perſon that defileth himſelfe with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, doth as it were take from himſelfe, and giue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not to enioy (for one cannot duly be honoured by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ignominie) but to deface and ſpoile him of it. He doth then thereby expoſe himſelfe, and his eſtimation to obliquie and contempt, that euery one which heareth of his filthy facts, ſhould haue him in deriſion, and deſpiſe him. The latter clauſe of this ſentence doth induce vs to thinke that this is the ſenſe of the former; when hee ſaith, <hi>and thy yeeres to the cruell,</hi> where <hi>giue,</hi> is referred indifferently to both, and it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident to al, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may take away life from his neighbour, but make no benefit of it to himſelfe, neuer any can poſſibly liue by another mans death: therefore theſe words doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſecond diſcommodity of whoredome, the endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his life, and yeeres that are behinde, <hi>to the cruell, viz.</hi> to any that ſhall fiercely purſue him: her husband, or other friends that are diſhonoured by it, her other louers; her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuals inflamed with enuie and ſpite; her ſelfe, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times poyſoneth thoſe which ſhe hath had to doe withall, that ſhe might the more freely proſtitute and giue ouer her ſelfe wholly to others whom ſhe better likes: or the hand of the Magiſtrate, whoſe office it is to cut off adulterers, who ſtirred vp by Gods iudgement, may proue very ſharpe in purſuing of him, and with as great ſeuerity as if he were cruell, though properly for that he is not to be ſo called, but iuſt and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The third is the loſſe of his goods, which in the Hebrew text is called ſtrength, and labour, becauſe thereby he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them: by which tearmes hee doth vpbraid him with
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:26745:47"/> ſottiſhnes and folly, which would ſo wretchleſly, and ſinfully depart with that whereupon hee beſtowed his ſtrength, and which hee compaſſed not without great paines and trauell. And this is yet further exaggerated by the perſons vpon whom it is conferred, viz. <hi>ſtrangers,</hi> and forrainers, not onely not of his owne blood, or alliance, to whom hee is bound in ſpeciall manner, by the law of good nature, but alſo not of his friends, to whom he oweth the ſecond dutie of kindneſſe. As if he ſhould haue ſaid: Thou ſhalt not only conſume and waſt that patrimony which hath been deſcended vpon thee, or been bequeathed to thee, that neither wife, child, brother, or friend, or thoſe that are neereſt vnto thee ſhall be the better for it, nor thy ſelfe haue the fruition of it but ſhall feede, yea in rich ſtrumpets, bawds, ruffians, and ill companions with that which thou haſt got by the toyle and labour of thine hands, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned dearely with the ſweate of thy browes.</p>

               <p>NOw wee come to the inward diſcommoditie, the griefe and vexation of the heart, which this impure behauiour produceth: which is argued partly by the cauſe, and partly by the effects: the cauſe is, <hi>the wasting of his fleſh and body,</hi> which vncleane perſons (if they eſcape death) doe fall into: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, ordinarily they ſpend their ſtrength, with their goods, and good names, and the hazard of their liues, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weake and feeble: how many filthy and loathſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes doe they fall into that giue themſelues vnto this ſinne: ſome ſo farre, that in the end their very bowels fall out, and there is great force in this argument: for albeit this miſchiefe befall not all adulterers, yet not one can ſecure himſelfe as free from the perill of it. The effects of their griefe are two: firſt, their crying, in this verſe: ſecondly, their complaining, in the three next. Their mourning and crying for the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of it is reſembled to the roring of a lion, for ſo much the word importeth.</p>

The holy Ghoſt therefore bringeth their owne teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, witneſſing how they are plagued, and not how they are conuerted: the ſinne which he acknowledgeth is not the direct act of adulterie, or fornication, but that which went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and made a way for the ſame, which was contempt of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> and reproofe; which he aggrauateth by the manner, that it was with hatred thereof, and the hatred from the root, euen from his heart, and therefore vehement and deadly: and the effect that followed vpon it, that he was diſobedient vnto thoſe which were ſet ouer him, and had authoritie to teach him. It is as if he ſhould haue ſaid: How long haue I hated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and correction? What a beaſt was I, and voide of common ſenſe ſo to deteſt that information and diſcipline, which would haue done me ſo much good, and reiected all that wholeſome aduice and counſell, which they that were wiſe, and knew what was beſt for me, which were alſo my friends, and ſhewed their faithfulnes, did miniſter vnto me?</p>

For the former, it is of large extent, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry generall; he ſaith that he is <hi>almoſt in all euill,</hi> there is ſcarce any miſerie which he is free from; hee is couered with ſhame, hee is pinched with want, hee is tormented with paine, hee is plagued in his name, in his goods, in his body, in his ſoule, in himſelfe, and thoſe that belong vnto him: for the latter, it is conſpicuous, and notorious: he ſaith, that he is in this caſe <hi>in the midst of the congregation and aſſemblie,</hi> either for that his facts, and misbehauiour are cenſured by the Magiſtrate to his often rebuke, and infamie in the publike aſſembly; or becauſe his plagues were vniuerſally knowne to the multitude, and all men vnderſtood what filthineſſe he had committed, and what calamities he now ſuſtained.

               <p>The former he propoundeth by way of queſtion, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>why,</hi> as if he hauing gathered his arguments together, he ſhould haue thus ſaid: Wherefore my ſonne, ſeeing whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome hath ſo many and ſo great diſcommodities and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts following on the one ſide, and a good wife brings ſo many, and ſo great comforts on the other; what cauſe or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there, why leauing or forſaking thy wife, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt giue thy ſelfe vnto an harlot, and commit wickedneſſe with her?

If there were no comfort to be found in the company of a lawfull wife, yet the diſcommodities that follow vpon a whore ſhould diſſwade thee from her.

               <p>THe latter part of this concluſion touching the dangerous eſtate of adulterers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee declareth by generall reaſons, which are common to other ſinnes with this. The firſt is from the cleere ſight of Gods eyes, which is ſuch, as all the waies of all men are ſeene of them, and ſo cleerely, diſtinctly, and perticularly, as if they lay, or were purpoſely ſet one by one ouer againſt his eyes, ſo that he need not to turne backe, or ſo much as to turne a ſide to looke vpon them. This argument is encreaſed by his curious noting and obſeruing all our pathes, which is enlightened by a metaphor of <hi>weighing them,</hi> as the Gold-ſmith doth his gold and ſiluer in a paire of bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lances.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>His owne iniquitie ſhall take the wicked himſelfe; and he ſhall he holden with the cords of his ſinnes.</hi>

See chap. 3. verſ. 23. and 14. verſ. 12. <hi>When we ſhall lye downe to ſleepe, ſhe ſhall keepe vs,</hi> and bee as it were a watch vnto vs, that we ſleepe ſecurely.

               </p>
               <p>HE confirmeth this reaſon by an argument taken from the excellency and vertue of this doctrine, which is cleerely ſet downe by familiar compariſons. The firſt, of a

                  <hi>lampe,</hi> whereof there is great vſe in the night; the ſecond of <hi>light,</hi> whereof there is ſingular vſe in the day: the third, that it is a <hi>beaten way,</hi> whereof there is great vſe for paſſengers, and trauellers, which he amplifieth by an argument from the leſſe to the greater: if the corrections and rebukes of it are ſo, what are then the milde directions and promiſes? and from the end whither it leadeth; namely, to life, <hi>viz.</hi> eternall bleſſedneſſe. So that whereas we and our waies are nothing elſe but night and darkeneſſe, and know not which way to moue hand or foot, but to our deſtruction, the doctrine of God is for the night, <hi>a canale,</hi> and for the day, <hi>the Sunne,</hi> that wee may ſee, and iourney in the ready high way of ſaluation.

               <p>Of the former there are two parts; firſt, an admonition, that

The ſecond is a caueat, that <hi>ſhee take him not with her eye lids:</hi> wherein he compareth the <hi>eye lids,</hi> and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of an harlot to a net, or ſnare, and the harlots heart, and her ſelfe to an hunter, or fowler, and the partie allured by her wanton lookes, to the bird, or beaſt caught in a net.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 26. <hi>For by meanes of a whoriſh woman,</hi> a man is brought <hi>to a morſell of bread, and the adultereſſe will hunt for pretious life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HEre hee backeth his admonition and caueat, with ſuch forcible conſiderations as might beſt worke vpon his reader, and make him to know how much it concerneth him to regard them; whereof two are here noted; the one, that this curſed ſinne draweth a man into pouerty, or beggery ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the other, a ſhamefull death, or that which is in ſtead of that, and worſe then that, an euerlaſting death. Touching the former, he ſaith, <hi>For an harlot,</hi> or by means of an harlot, <hi>a man is brought to a morſell of bread,</hi> from plentie, to penurie; from variety of diſhes to one kinde, and that is dry bread; and from ſufficiencie and fulneſſe, to a ſhort pittance, euen one morſell, and many times this is to be asked at another mans doore, or at leaſt to be giuen as an almes from another mans hand. See for this, chap. 5. 10.</p>
               <p>The latter is loſſe of life, which all the attempts of the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe (the married woman breaking the bands of wedlocke) doe tend vnto. <hi>She hunteth for pretious life,</hi> wherein he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth her to a cruell hunter, which purſueth an Hare, or other beaſt, not to catch onely, but to kill it: which though ſhe doe not directly intend and aime at, yet ſhe effecteth and bringeth to paſſe: for through her allurements, the perſon committing
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:26745:58"/> follie with her is expoſed to the rage of her husband, whoſe indignation is implacable, the ſword of the Magiſtrate, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſeuerely againſt him, if not for the ſame crime, yet for ſome other thereby occaſioned; and the wrath of God, who will either inflict a temporall puniſhment, to the vtter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body, or elſe powre downe intollerable plagues vpon the body and ſoule for euer. And this ſo prodigall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of life is hereby the more condemnable, in that it is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> of ſuch an excellent creation by Gods owne hand, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration rather by his breath, and carrying ſuch a ſtampe of his glorious image, and capable of ſuch eternal bliſſe as Chriſt hath purchaſed with his owne blood, and euery one ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy, which through ſinne doth not make forfeiture of it.</p>

The parts are three: the firſt is, an inſtigation to the ſtudious keeping of wiſedome and knowledge, in the fiue firſt verſes. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, a narration of thoſe things which hee had ſeene and obſerued in her impudent behauiour, and anſwerable ſucceſſe, to the 24. verſe. The third is an application of the ſame vnto his readers, as an admonition and warning vnto them, in the foure laſt verſes.</p>
               <p>In the firſt verſe, the Prophet returneth againe to his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall exhortation of receiuing, and keeping the doctrine, which he propoundeth, and is the ſame with the beginning of the ſecond chapter.</p>
               <p>Verſe 2. <hi>Keepe my commandements, and liue; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO ſet an edge vpon his exhortation, that it might preuaile the better with vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he addeth a promiſe of life, and that he doth after a moſt emphaticall manner, commanding vs to <hi>liue;</hi> thereby teaching, how preſent, and certaine the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is that belongeth to the obedience of his precepts. After he expreſſeth the manner how he would haue vs to keepe his doctrine, by a ſimilitude, <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>the apple of the eye,</hi> as that which is moſt precious vnto thee: for a man will ward, and keepe off violence from his head, before all other parts of his

               </p>
               <p>HE deliuereth the ſame precept in allegoricall ſpeeches: and firſt, he requireth to <hi>binde them vpon our fingers,</hi> that they may be as rings thereon, and for memorandums, as wee vſe to tye a thread or ſilke about our fingers, to put vs in mind of matters not to bee forgotten, and to write them <hi>vpon the table of our heart,</hi> viz. that they may be as a tablet hanging on our breaſt: as chap. 3. 3.</p>
               <p>As if he could not ſatisfie himſelfe in this argument, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth the ſame thing in another ſimilitude, wherein hee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth a perſon to Wiſedome, and requireth that there bee ſuch inward friendſhip and familiaritie betwixt vs and her, as if ſhe were our ſiſter, and neereſt kinſwoman. It is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thing to brothers and ſiſters, if they loue as they ought, to liue together in one houſe, as <hi>Lazarus, Martha,</hi> and <hi>Mary:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 11</note> or if by occaſion of mariage they liue in diuers houſes, yet they delight one in another, and feaſt together, as did <hi>Iobs</hi>

And thus conuerſant and familiar ought we to be with Wiſedome, and ſo much the rather becauſe we are ſtrangers in the world, and hated of the world, becauſe by this kindred and affinitie with Wiſedome, we become of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and alliance with our Sauiour Chriſt.</p>

And this ſhe doth partly by vncomely actions: partly by countenance, ſhewing a braſen face, without feare, or ſhamefaſtnes: and partly by diſſembling ſpeeches, ſuch as hereafter follow. Her vncomely actions here ſpecified are three. The one is, that <hi>ſhe laid hold on him:</hi> ſhe ſhould not haue indured him to <hi>lay hold</hi> on her; but for her to lay hold on him, was beyond all woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly modeſtie: the other, that ſhe kiſſed him.

The manner of the Iſraelites, and that according to the law of God, was, that in the Lords offerings, the fat and blood being offered, part of the fleſh ſhould goe to the Prieſts, and part to him that brought it: whereof they made a feaſt, (for it was ſomewhat

The holy Ghoſt alſo declareth the degrees of his falling, and as it were the ſteps of his deſcending.

               <p>Vnto this he addeth a reaſon taken from the effect, <hi>bleſſed are they that keepe my waies:</hi> which is an argument of greateſt weight and force that can be vſed. For what is it that all men ſeeke but happineſſe?</p>

A baſtard will after a ſort ſometimes heare do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and conſolation; but he is a naturall ſonne of wiſdome that will hearken to her checkes and reproofes. The ſecond is, <hi>and be wiſe,</hi> which is the effect of Wiſdomes inſtruction, and reprehenſion: for the word of God is able to make vs wiſe to ſaluation; and therefore aduiſing to be wiſe, he inciteth vs to thoſe meanes whereby we may attaine vnto wiſedome. The<note place="margin">Tiphragnu.</note> third is, <hi>refuſe not;</hi> the word ſignifieth both <hi>to put away,</hi> and <hi>to fall away,</hi> or to make a defection. It is a great indignity offred vnto Wiſedome, to refuſe and put her away, when ſhee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her ſelfe to vs in her inſtructions, and worthie are they to periſh in their follie that ſhall ſo doe: but it is yet a more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie thing, hauing in ſome ſort yeelded to her, to reuolt from her, and caſt her off; for ſhe neuer giueth to any man the leaſt cauſe ſo to deale with her.</p>

And firſt, in this verſe hee deſcribeth that attention and hearing of wiſedome by the manner of it, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing therein aſſiduity, and continuall attendance by a compariſon taken from the cuſtome of clients and ſuters, who waite day by day, and houre by houre, at the gates of Princes, Councellors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other great men, to exhibite their petitions and to get their cauſes fauoured, heard, and ended, which is the conſtant exerciſe of religious ſeruices.</p>

               <p>IN the former words was ſhewed what preparation wiſdom made for her feaſt at home, and in theſe what courſe ſhe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to inuite the gueſts abroad.

               <p>Firſt, in a peculiar, namely, long life: which is not ſo to bee vnderſtood as though it were perpetual, and ſo of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: for then good men muſt grow to be old men, and all which die young, ſhould die wicked and damned: but that God hath the keeping of their liues in ſuch good ſafety as they ſhall neuer be taken away before due ſeaſon: they ſhall not die ſo ſoone, as that it would bee better for them to liue longer: nor liue ſo long, as that it might be hurtfull they died not ſooner. The point doth <hi>Eliphaz</hi> trulie expound to <hi>Iob,</hi> and all other righteous perſons: Iob 5. 26. <hi>Thou ſhalt goe to thy graue in a full age as a crop of corne commeth in due ſeaſon into the barne.</hi> Now all graine is not of equall proportion of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:26745:78"/> growth: ſome is ſowne before others, and yet is cut downe after them: ſome is ſowne after others, and commeth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity before them: ſo that good husbands diſpoſe not of their harueſt by meaſure of time, but by the ripeneſſe of their corne: and two extremities they prouidently auoide; neither too haſtily to inne the fruites of their fields or trees, for ſo they would wither away: neither to deferre the gathering of them after they bee ripe, for ſo they would drop off, and ſhed, and grow to rottenneſſe. Afterwards he declareth the recompence of wiſdome in generall: that the poſſeſſion and practiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not onely a ſeruice to God, nor alone for his ſake ſo often required: but redoundeth alſo to the profit of them that bee owners and performers of it. And to this is oppoſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſtate of thoſe peruerſe and wilfull ſcorners, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their deſire and purpoſe is to doe miſchiefe to others, yet all their malice returneth on their owne heads.</p>

And here, as alſo in that which followeth, ſhee is deſcribed by her qualities and behauiour, carrying the right ſtampe and print of an harlot. One thing is, that ſhee is giuen to much talke, to make a noiſe: which was the note of the whoriſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Chap. 7. 11.

And though ſhe haue a lauiſh tongue, yet wee know (according as wee vſe to ſay) that none is ſo bold as blind Bayard.

And therefore he demonſtrateth the contrarie effects of contrarie men; namely, of ſlothfull perſons, and ſuch as be induſtrious and painfull. Slothfull perſons fall into two euils: the one is the practiſe of deceitfulnes, called here a deceitfull hand: the other is the burthen of pouerty, which is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment inflicted vpon them both for fraud and idleneſſe. They that bee diligent haue their reward yeelded vnto them, that they thriue and proſper by the labour of their hands: &amp; though their wealth bee not ſo great in quantitie, yet the ſmalneſſe thereof is recompenſed in quality and good vſe of it; and therefore is called, <hi>pretious riches,</hi> Chap. 12. 27.

               <p>THis is one particular of the bleſſings mentioned in the former verſe, that that which is neereſt to a man, as his name, ſhall be in eſtimation, and good account.

               <p>THis confirmeth the latter clauſe of the former verſe, That they that peruert their waies ſhall bee knowne, though they doe it neuer ſo ſecretly, which is meant by the winking of the eye.

And yet all winking is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned: but that which tendeth to hurt, when men winke wiles. The Apoſtle beckned or winked at <hi>Iohn</hi> that he ſhould<note place="margin">Ioh. 13. 24.</note> aske who it was that ſhould betray Chriſt, and yet this was well done of him; for he ſhewed a reuerend regard of Chriſt, that he would not be loud and audacious in his preſence.

               <p>Verſe 11. <hi>The mouth of a righteous man is a welſpring of life: but iniquitie couereth the mouth of the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN Iſrael, and in the countries bordering vpon it, it was a great benefit to haue wels of water, both for the vſe of men and of the cattell, and therfore things of great account be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times compared to them in the Scriptures, and heere the mouth of a righteous man is ſo called in a double reſpect, both for the conſtancie of good conference (according to the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, for ſuch ſprings as were continuall, and would hold out as well in ſommer as in winter, were ſaid to be wels of liuing water: Gen. 26. 19. as alſo, and eſpecially for the good effect, that they bee inſtruments ſometimes to beget, and vſually to confirme and refreſh the life of the ſoule. The latter part of the verſe hath been expounded in the ſixth verſe.</p>
               <p>The expoſition ſtandeth thus: The mouth of a righteous

               <p>THeſe words neede no further explanation, then the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of that which is to be vnderſtood in both the clauſes. For this ſeemeth to be the ſenſe of them: In the lips or ſpeech of him that hath vnderſtanding wiſedome is found, which keepeth iudgements and puniſhments from him: but in the lips of him that wanteth vnderſtanding follie is found; which bringeth iudgements and puniſhment vpon him. The firſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtich, or former part of the verſe, is the ſame ſimply ſet downe, and without allegorie or metaphore, as was compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiuely vttered in the eleuenth verſe, by the ſimilitude of a wel-ſpring.</p>
               <p>The latter part is the ſame in ſenſe that was in the eighth and tenth verſes: for there it is ſaid; that <hi>the fooliſh in talke ſhall be beaten.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>HEre is declared by what meanes wiſe men attaine to that abilitie and ſufficiencie of fruitfull ſpeeches, by due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to that which is ſpoken to them or which they reade: or by diligent obſeruation of things which they behold. Thoſe they lay vp, as a man would his treaſure, in a ſafe place. As therefore a prouident thriftie husband, which hath gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together a ſtocke, will bee ready vpon ſhort warning to make a purchaſe, or vpon any good occaſion to disburſe a ſum of money: ſo hee that is faithfull in ſeeking knowledge, and applieth both heart and memorie to hold it faſt, and keepe it, ſhall readily in conuenient time draw out the good things which he hath learned, either for his owne vſe, or the benefit and profit of others. Which is contrary in careleſſe and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe perſons: for they will be as forward to ſpeake as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but that which is within the heart, will quickly bee at hand to come out at the lips, and that is poyſon, and venome, and peſtilent matter, which will certainly hurt themſelues, and be dangerous to other. So then thus ſtandeth the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wiſe men lay vp knowledge, and therfore their mouthes are a preſent preſeruation: but fooliſh men reiect knowledge; and therefore their mouthes are a preſent deſtruction.</p>

For hee ſpeaketh not of any ſafety that they haue by their goods; but which they ſeeme to themſelues to haue; as is plainely expreſſed, Chap. 18. 11. They are as an high wall in his imagination: and it is ſometimes the fault of good men in their infirmities, to repoſe too much confidence in outward things, when they abound with them; as euen <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>

                  <hi>THe labour of the righteous tendeth to life,</hi> &amp;c.] That is, the goods that good men vſually get by trauell (though many times they are deſcended to them by inheritance, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon them by gift, or by ſome other lawfull meanes brought to their hands) <hi>tendeth to life, viz.</hi> both of ſoule and body in this world, and for the world to come: whereas the riches of vngodly men are alwaies abuſed by them, and made the occaſions and meanes of vnrighteouſneſſe. The oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this: the riches of the righteous doe tend to goodneſſe, and ſo to their life: but the wealth of the wicked doth tend to ſinne, and ſo to their death. For euery mans ſubſtance is a meanes of his benificence and well doing, or an occaſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him of ſinning: either it induceth him to ſhew mercy, and to doe good, which the Lord will recompence with life and bleſſedneſſe: or elſe he is thereby incited to pride, cruelty, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſſe, riot, prodigality, or nigardize, or other like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant courſes, whereby he maketh himſelfe liable to Gods curſes, and his owne perdition.</p>

But the Lord, which knoweth the ground and roote of their calumniations and cauils, imputeth them to their proper cauſe: and that is, the ſinfulneſſe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of thoſe malicious deſpiſers.</p>

The words immediately going before theſe, declare how ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it, by inward hatred and bitterneſſe of heart, and yet out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly make ſemblance of great loue and friendſhip: others
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:26745:86"/> breake out into open profeſſion of their diſcontentment and malice, by reproching thoſe that would helpe them out of their ſins: and here commeth a third ſort, which would ſhift off all rebukes, by denying, defending, cloking, or colouring their faults by excuſing, &amp; extenuating matters that are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vpon them. But all is in vaine; the ſin will not be blowne away with breath: and therefore he ſheweth that it is a point of wiſedome to giue place by ſilence, and to take the blame vpon them.</p>

Which is contrary in the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; becauſe there is a contrary fountaine in him of ſinfulnes and corruption, and no matter of vertue and grace, which are the ſprings of all wholeſome ſpeeches. Thus therefore ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the <hi>Antitheſis:</hi> the tongue of the iuſt man is as ſined ſiluer; becauſe his heart is pretious: but the tongue of the wicked is as droſſe; becauſe his heart is nothing worth.</p>

The which againe is oppoſed the way of the wicked, euen their owne ſinfull courſe of life, being crooked and cragged, and rough, and rugged, and full of manifold perils, wherein at laſt they fall and periſh. In appearance the path of grace &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes is ſo full of troubles and difficulties, as that it ſhould bee impoſſible for any man to goe along in it, and not be ſtopped, or turned aſide before he come to his liues end, and yet a good conſcience findeth eaſe therein: and the broad way of ſinne wherein the world walketh, ſeemeth very plaine and pleaſant, as alſo voide of all annoiances, or dangers, but euery one that trauelleth in it meeteth with many externall croſſes, ſuch as they neuer doubted of; or internall terrors and vexations, ſuch as they neuer dreaded, and at laſt proceeding on impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently, they ſtumble at, and are ouerthrowne by one iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

And as the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to be ſound for the matter; ſo muſt it be reaſonable for the manner: as ſpoken in due time; in meete place; and fitly applied: wherein <hi>Ioabs</hi> friends much failed, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the men were godly, and their words very true and waightie. And yet further to theſe muſt be added of his part, that will drink of this liuely fountaine; an attentiue eare, and beleeuing heart to heare and embrace the doctrine. And then it will be conſtant, and not dried vp like ditches or ponds, that are fed with raine water: it will be comfortable, and refreſh the hearts of them that are in affliction: it will be profitable, and make them that receiue it, fruitfull: it will be neceſſarie

The coherence and agreement of one part with the other will be the more euident, if that be ſupplied which is vnderſtood in both.

               <p>The latter clauſe of this verſe preuenteth an obiection that might be made againſt the former, in this manner: Why ſhould righteouſneſſe bee commended for making the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous rich, ſithence ſinne ſeemeth to make the ſtate of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners more proſperous then theirs?

Then muſt they needs fall into indigency and want, and being not able to ſuſtaine the violence thereof, (for none are ſo impatient of pouerty, as thoſe who retchleſly throw themſelues into it) they will liue by their wits, and ſhift for themſelues, by falſhood and indirect courſes.</p>
               <p>The third, which is the puniſhment of all the former, is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and miſerable neceſſity, which their fraud, and deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth double vpon them, and not preuent, or diminiſh. Or if it fall out that ſome by wrongfull dealing are holpen in their ſtate for a time, yet it turneth to their greater hurt, and deeper decay in time following: or if they thriue euen to their liues end, by their vniuſt and fraudulent practiſes, yet they ſhall rue it in the worlds end, for the <hi>miſeries</hi> and plagues that<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 1.</note> will come vpon them, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> doth teſtifie.</p>

It is a borrowed ſpeech from men, who ſhew their ſtrength, and performe their actions, principally by their hands. Now this is true alſo of ſubiects, and inferiour perſons: For all mens hearts are in his <hi>hands,</hi> but hee nameth <hi>Kings,</hi> becauſe they of all others are moſt abſolute, &amp; not ſubiect to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandment of any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore his power doth the more appeare in the ruling and ouerruling of them, and it followeth by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent that none other can reſiſt him: and this hee illuſtrateth by a compariſon fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the like, <hi>the riuers of waters,</hi> the ſtreames, flouds, and tides, thoſe headie, violent, and boyſterous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which no man, or all men can tame or gouerne, and yet by him are commanded, reſtrained, and eaſily ordered; as were the red ſea, and Iordan, and the great inundation in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> time, when God called vp the huge depthes out of the earth, and opened the windowes of heauen to let downe flouds from aboue, that all theſe waters ſhould meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to couer the earth, and yet in a ſhort time (by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment) they all returned to their places, without any ſtay or lingering. <hi>He turneth it whitherſoeuer he will,</hi> his grace gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the godly, his power driueth the wicked, and his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence preuaileth with both, that they, and all their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are wholly at his diſpoſing: yet doth he not giue any of them commandement, encouragement, or toleration to doe euil, neither infuſeth corruption into their hearts, whereby he ſhould become the authour of their euill doings. That then
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:26745:169"/> which he affirmeth and teacheth, is, that the Lord hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident hand in the gouerning of all gouernours. The dignity and preheminence ouer their ſubiects, is very large and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but farre inferiour to his owne ouer them. For hee ruleth in the heart, which they cannot deale with; and effectually di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth euery action of all commanders, which no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath power to doe, in the ſeuerall affaires of his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: hee maketh them flexible to his purpoſes, and boweth their minds which way it pleaſeth him: whether it be to ſhew fauor, as one <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did to <hi>Iacob,</hi> in <hi>Ioſephs</hi> time; or to deale vniuſtly and cruelly as another <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did to <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Ioſephs</hi> death: and this commeth to paſſe, becauſe he made the men, and faſhioneth their hearts: hee giueth them the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer<note place="margin">Pſal. 33. 15.</note> of ſence, of cogitation and purpoſe; all the motions of life are his gift, becauſe hee hath not onely made them crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and men, but Potentates alſo, and mighty men: their greatneſſe is as well from him, as their ſubſtance and being, &amp; therfore both the one and the other muſt needs be for him.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 2. <hi>Euery way of a man is right in his owne eyes: but the Lord pondereth the heart.</hi>

               <p>PRoud and ignorant perſons, the moſt ſottiſh and fooliſh of all others, are ſo inamoured with the liking of their owne doings, and giuen to flatter themſelues in the eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their owne courſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as that they deeme all to be well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed which they manage, and nothing worthy of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion which they ſay or enterpriſe, bee it neuer ſo vnlawfull and abſurd. Whileſt <hi>Paul</hi> liued without the knowledge <hi>of the law,</hi> and in the continuall tranſgreſſion thereof, he moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the happineſſe of his eſtate: he thought himſelfe then to be <hi>aliue,</hi> notwithſtanding that ſin liued and raigned in him,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 9.</note> to the death of his ſoule, and ſo to his damnation, had not Chriſt by grace deliuered him from the ſame. And our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our fore-ſignified to his ſeruants what entreaty they ſhould looke for at the hands of ſuch as had no knowledge of him,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16. 2.</note> that they would thinke that they did an acceptable ſeruice to

And thus much Chriſt himſelfe gaue the bragging and concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Phariſes to vnderſtand, when he ſaid: <hi>ye are they which iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie your ſelues before men, but God knoweth your hearts: for</hi>

And therefore by faithfull execution of iuſtice and iudgement, they that are vnfainedly righteous may chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be diſcerned from diſſemblers, and hypocrites.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, better ſeruice is performed to the Lord for the honour of religion, greater good is done to our brethren for the benefit of mankinde, and larger reward wil be giuen to our ſelues, for our eternall happines, by diſcharging the ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all &amp; more neceſſary duties of righteouſnes, then by reſting in the circumſtantiall, or leſſe weightier exerciſes of religion.</p>

Vnto which diligent man is oppoſed the haſtie perſon, one that boyleth with an immoderate deſire of riches, and to bee wealthie all at once without delay; whom though he be not vtterly idle, yet God reputeth no better then a ſluggard, becauſe he is not well oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, nor willing to continue his diligence, if euer he ſhewed any, as his greedie longing after goods doth declare, to the end he may be freed from much trauell, and would get a great deale of ſubſtance with a little labour.

               <p>HE ſheweth another vſe and fruit of his doctrine, and all Gods words, which is internall, and that which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the inward man, which is hope, confidence, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon God: as if he ſhould haue ſaid: To the intent thou maieſt neither deſpaire, nor yet ſecurely leane vnto thine owne wiſedome, I haue both by my words and writings gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee ſuch inſtruction, as ſhew both <hi>Iehouah</hi> to be the true, eternall, and all-ſufficient God, as alſo declare the duties of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, wherein men are to walke before him.

               <p>Touching the former, he beginneth with the moſt generall, and that is <hi>woe,</hi> extreame griefe and miſerie, temporall, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting: For the Scripture is wont to call euery heauie iudgement of the Lord in this life, and eternall condemnation by the name of woe: and then deſcendeth to perticulars, as that it inforceth him to crie out for miſerie, with groaning, and ſighing, and to bewaile his poore and miſerable eſtate: for ſo much the word importeth. And next that it cauſeth <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious</hi> brablings, and weepings: For drunkards at their cups are wont to cauell one with another, to brawle, ſcold, and rage like people out of their wits. See chap. 20. 1. Thirdly, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to <hi>babble:</hi> For when the wine is in the wit is out: For neither can they be ſilent, nor truſtely keepe any ſecret: then they fall to ſcoffe and ieſt one vpon another, vpon euery light occaſion, or talke vainly, or friuolouſly, without any vſe or wiſedome: or elſe inueigh bitterly againſt Magiſtrates, Preachers, and godly people. Fourthly, it procureth wounds without cauſe, not but that the drunkard deſerueth to bee wounded with puniſhment, but that they haue no cauſe to aduenture themſelues to ſuch perill: they muſt take the blame
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:26745:202"/> vpon themſelues, as hauing no calling to draw them into ſuch dangers: they were not hurt in the field, nor in warfare: it was in no ſeruice for the Prince, or Countrie: either they fell downe, and hurt themſelues: or elſe for their raſh ſpeeches, or other diſordered behauiour, they receiued ſtripes, and ſo were wounded. Laſt of all, it hurteth the countenance, and diſfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the face, through heate and inflammation, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelfe in the <hi>rednes of the eyes,</hi> much drinking cauſeth hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours to abound in the body, eſpecially in the face, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the eyes, which are thereby oftentimes blemiſhed, and almoſt blinded. The cauſe of all this conſiſteth firſt in the quantitie of that they drinke, and then in the qualitie of the ſame. The quantitie is, that they drinke exceſſiuely: For as they tarrie long at it, ſo all the time, or the moſt part of it, they are buſie about it: for a little ſerueth not their turne, but they m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The parts thereof are two: the one is a charge giuen to ſinfull men, that they proceede not on in their craft, or in their crueltie againſt the ſeruants of God, in the former verſe: and the other, a reaſon which could cauſe them to ſtand backe, and not offer ſuch iniuries to them, in the latter. <hi>Lay not waite,</hi> deale not ſubtilly, practiſe not any ſecret miſchiefe, like to ſuch as lurke in corners ſuddenly to ſurpriſe a man, or get ſome aduantage againſt him, <hi>againſt the houſe of the righteous,</hi> againſt a man himſelfe, or any thing that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth vnto him: <hi>ſpoyle not his resting place,</hi> offer no violence
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:26745:209"/> vnto, nor prey vpon his goods, and eſpecially goe not about to ouerthrow his dwelling place, nor chaſe him from it: For it is as if he ſhould haue ſaid, This is thy practiſe, and which is to be looked for at thine hand, vntill thou ceaſe to bee wicked. For all thy attempts be in vaine, and ſhall take no place: and therefore if thou wert wiſe and prudent for thy ſelfe, thou wouldeſt be better aduiſed, before thou tookeſt ſuch courſes. The reaſon is from the contrary condition of the wicked, and godly: the one endureth many troubles, and eſcapeth out of them all: the other, oft times more croſſes come vpon them for a time: but ſome one deadly ſtroke commeth at laſt for all, to their vtter vndoing: <hi>The iust falleth ſeuen times,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into troubles very oft, a certaine number of times being put for an vncertaine, <hi>but riſeth againe,</hi> but by the gracious hand of God is deliuered out of them all. It is a ſimilitude from childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> led of their parents, who though through weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doe ſometimes ſtumble, and fall to the ground, yet they be neither hurt with the fall, nor helpleſſe, that they ſhould not be taken vp againe. So that the goodneſſe of God doth more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in ſuſtaining his people in their troubles, then in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">Pſal. 34. 19.

So that albeit croſſes come but ſeldome vpon vngodly men, and miſerie tarrie long before it viſite them; yet when God ſetteth in with them, he paieth them home, euen to their ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: For ſo are they threatned: <hi>The Lord ſhall ſhoote an</hi>

<pb n="427" facs="tcp:26745:222" rendition="simple:additions"/> the ſetled griefe of the heart. The third is muſike, or melodie, it is called the <hi>ſinging of ſongs,</hi> chearing the heart in ſorrow and heauineſſe, as a pleaſant harmonie, or well tuned dittie, ſung with a ſweete voyce, affecteth the care.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THe holy Ghoſt in this place (as he doth expound himſelfe in the new Teſtament, doth giue a precept for Chriſtian charity to our aduerſaries which hate vs, that we ſhould ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 10.</note> their malice with beneficence and well doing: and to this purpoſe preſcribeth a dutie in the former verſe, teaching vs how to deale with him; and ſoliciteth vs thereunto by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible arguments in the latter. The dutie is, that in caſe <hi>our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie hunger, we ſhould feede him, &amp;c.</hi> if hee be in any want, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our abilitie and opportunitie we muſt miniſter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, denying him no helpe or couteſie at his neede: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the law requireth the ſame, inſtancing in other offices of loue and humanitie: as, <hi>If thou meete thine enemies oxe, or his aſſe going astray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring it backe to him againe:</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The arguments are two: the firſt from the end: the ſecond from the effect. The end is that we may reconcile him to vs, if it be poſſible; and winne his loue, by powring <hi>coales of fire on his head,</hi> by heaping vp many benefits vpon him: For it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be a compariſon taken from founders, or caſters of mettall, who by adding too much fuell, and making a great fire, will make the hardeſt iron and ſteele at the laſt to melt, and become liquid: and if there be any mettall of ingenuiety and good nature in ſuch foes: if they be not wholly made of droſſe, they will be pacified, and will not after ſo many &amp; great good turnes continue implacable. Euen that waiward <hi>Saul,</hi>

               <p>Hauing ſuch an aduantage to ſlay him, and onely cut off a piece of his coate, when he might with as much eaſe haue cut off his head: this kindneſſe of <hi>Dauids</hi> did ſo affect <hi>Saul,</hi> and wrought vpon him, that hee called him his ſonne now, whom before he proclaimed a traytor, and prayed to the Lord to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence vnto him the goodneſſe which he had ſhewen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, whereas formerly hee deſired nothing but his ruine and deſtruction. All good meanes therefore are to be vſed, to make our enemies to be better minded toward vs, whatſoeuer the ſucceſſe be: let our fire of goodneſſe be as great as we can make it: for that we know not what they may proue, whether leade, or tinne, or braſſe, or ſiluer, or gold, &amp;c. vnto this we are perſwaded by the Prophet, ſaying, <hi>Seeke peace, and follow after it,</hi> purſue it with patience, long ſufferance, forbearance, with pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>ſaying, What is this?</hi> Therefore no man ought to be confident of that which ſhall be hereafter. <hi>Dauid</hi> acknowledgeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be too bold, and that therfore he was worthely corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for it, when he bragged in this maner, <hi>I ſaid in my proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I ſhall neuer be moued:</hi> the reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt not thus boaſt, is from the vncertainty of all future euents: becauſe <hi>thou knoweſt not what a day may bring foorth,</hi> what things may fall out this day to preuent all thine expectation to morrow, or what may come to paſſe to morrow, cleane contrary to that which thou didſt expect this day. The day is ſaid to bring forth by a compariſon taken from women with child, or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures great with yong: becauſe time trauelleth with the Lords decrees, and in their ſeaſon bringeth forth the ſame, euen as a woman doth her babe, or little infant, and what ſhall bee borne at any time, none in the world doth know: euery day, and euery night, and euery houre, and euery moment is bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth ſuch a birth, as all the world is ignorant of: becauſe Gods purpoſes are knowne to himſelfe, and concealed from his creatures: the accidents, and occurrents of this life, are ſo hidden from men, that they cannot conclude vpon warrant and certainty what ſhall be anone, who knoweth whether his life will laſt till anone: little dreamed <hi>Haman</hi> that purpoſed to be ſo merrie at the Queenes feaſt, that hee ſhould be hanged
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:26745:234"/> before his dinner time was paſt. Therefore S. <hi>Iames</hi> taxeth thoſe who are ſo large in promiſes, for their owne good ſpeed and commoditie in their traffique, and merchandiſe: ſaying, <hi>Goe to now yee that ſay, to day, or to morrow, wee will goe into ſuch a citie or country, and continue there a yeere, and buy, and ſell, and get gaine Whereas ye know not what ſhall be on the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: For what is your life, it is a ſhadow, &amp;c.</hi>

Finally, it is needleſſe for men to magnifie themſelues, if they bee faithfull: for God will bring their righteouſneſſe to light, and men wil yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the honour of their vertues, though they hold their peace: neuertheleſſe it is neceſſarie for a man in ſome caſes to teſtifie his graces and actions: as in defence of his innocencie, when he is vniuſtly traduced, as <hi>Paul</hi> was: or when the hiding

Many times anger is for faults<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and things done amiſſe, or at the leaſt they ſeeme ſuch to him, that is moued at them: but enuie is vſually for goodneſſe, and againſt good men; and therefore alwaies the beſt haue been moſt enui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>AS in the former verſe, her care was declared in prouiding matter of imployment for her ſelfe, and her people, that ſhe would finde ſome what to worke vpon: ſo in this her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, for food and prouiſion, is commended, that as ſhe would neither haue her ſelfe, nor thoſe that bee about her to want worke, or be remiſſe in it: ſo ſhe ordereth the matter, that there be no want of victuals or other neceſſaries whereby life is preſerued, and without competencie whereof no man can be able to labour, or doe any ſeruice with cheerefulnes: and in this reſpect ſhe is compared to the <hi>merchants ſhips,</hi> who carrying forth ſome one commoditie into forren countries, returne thence, bringing home ſundry others for it: for all countries are not inriched after one manner: ſome haue great ſtore of corne: others abound with vines, and wine: ſome haue plentie of fruits: others are ſtored with mines, and mettals:

In like manner that which ſhe hath to ſpare at home, ſhe felleth to her neighbours which want the ſame: that which is wanting vnto her, ſhe buyeth of them that are able, and willing to vtter it for money, and wares, according as they can agree: but haue it ſhe will vpon good conditions, and compaſſe it by ſuch manner of trafficke as ſhall be commodious to both ſides.</p>
